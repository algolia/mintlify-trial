    **Alternative items**

    [This Recommend model](/guides/algolia-recommend/onboard/related-products/overview/) helps you display a block of products that are related to the selected product.
    It looks at user interactions, such as clicks, to determine which products are similar to the selected ones.

  </Step>
  <Step title="How to add a product comparison table to your app">
    The building block for this custom layout is the `useRelatedProducts()` Hook from the React InstantSearch library.
    In a nutshell, you can quickly integrate a product comparison table in your product details page, by following a few steps.

    It is easier to render the list of attributes and the retrieved recommendations by column.
    Keep in mind a few tips, like also sending the selected product to the custom widget and limiting the retrieved recommendations to 2 or 3, for comparison.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="React InstantSearch">
        To shape the **Related Products** model in the product comparison table,
        you will have to create a custom widget based on `useRelatedProducts()`, and provide it with a custom item component in the `itemComponent` prop.

        You should also provide the currently selected product to the custom widget,
        as well as limit the retrieved recommendation to two (or more, depending on your use case) by setting `limit={2}`, as shown in the code example.

        ```jsx JSX
        <InstantSearch searchClient={searchClient} indexName={indexName}>
          <ComparisonTableView
            objectIDs={[selectedProduct.objectID]}
            limit={2}
            currentItem={selectedProduct}
            itemComponent={({ item }) => (
              <ComparisonTableItem item={item} />
            )}
          />
        </InstantSearch>
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="Create the custom widget">
        Retrieve the recommendations with `useRelatedProducts()`,
        then extract and format the attributes' names that you will like to display in the table.
        Ensure you exclude the image attribute.
        In this example, most of the attributes have been exracted and each name capitalized.

        ```jsx JSX
        const ComparisonTableView = ({ 
          currentItem, 
          itemComponent, 
          ...props,
        }) => {
          [...]
          // Create a new array containing the selected 
          // product and the retrieved recommendations
          const { items } = useRelatedProducts(props);
          const allItems = Array.from(new Set([currentItem, ...items]));
          const properties = extractAndFormatProperties(Object.keys(first(items)));
          [...]
        }
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Render the extracted attributes">
        Render these extracted and formatted attributes as a column.

        ```jsx JSX
        <div className="propertiesContainer">
          <div className="propertiesHeading">
            <div>Overview</div>
          </div>
          <div className="propertiesContainer">
            {properties.map((property) => (
              <div className="propertyContainer">
                <div className="propertyContent">{property}</div>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Display each item by column">
        Display only the item attributes that are part of the comparison
        Do this by rendering the custom `itemComponent` prop for each item, as shown in the code below.

        ```jsx JSX
        {allItems.map((item) => (
          <div key={item.objectID}>
            <itemComponent item={item} />
          </div>
        ))}
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create the custom item component">
        You will have to create the custom item component view.
        You will have to display each of the selected item attributes as a column,
        making sure that the column heights are the same as the ones from the attributes (left-most) column.

        ```jsx JSX
        <div className="itemsContainer">
          <div className="itemImgContainer">
            <img
              className="imageContent"
              src={item.image}
              alt="placeholder img"
            />
          </div>
          <div className="itemAttributeContainer">
            <div className="itemAttributeContent">{item.title}</div>
          </div>
          <div className="itemAttributeContainer">
            <div className="itemAttributeContent">{item.price}</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Customise how the item attributes should be displayed">
        In this example, a check or X icon is displayed for boolean attributes,
        but you can add more custom views, such as star rating for reviews.

        ```jsx JSX
        <div className="itemAttributeContainer">
          {item.noiseCancelling ? <Check size={20} /> : <X size={20} />}
        </div>
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Next steps">
        You've just built a product comparison table layout with Algolia Recommend.

        Now you can start [training your own Related Products model](https://dashboard.algolia.com/recommend/models) and build a product comparison table for your own app.
