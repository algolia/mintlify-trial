  Learn how to remove variants from your recommendations by using Recommend deduplication.
---

With Recommend deduplication, you can refine your recommendations by removing item variants from your AI model training.
The feature offers several advantages:

- **Improves recommendation accuracy and speed** by removing item variants before the training process.
- **Improves recommendation quality** by using events from all item variants.
- **Separates deduplication from search** so it doesn't affect the search experience.

## Recommend deduplication versus search deduplication

Algolia offers two types of deduplication:

- **Search deduplication** [removes duplicate items from search results](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/grouping/). This can help improve the relevance of the results and make them more user-friendly.
- **Recommend deduplication** remove duplicate items from Algolia AI recommendations. This can help improve the diversity of the recommendations and make them more personalized.

With Recommend deduplication, your AI models are **trained with all variants**, and the recommendations then **filtered by the API** before sending you the results to remove variants.

## How Recommend deduplication works

Recommend deduplication adds two processes to your AI model training:

- **Pre-training process**: generates a training dataset with only one variant per item. It also merges all events from variants of the same item.
- **Post-training process**: add all the variants dropped during the pre-training process back into the final set of recommendations.

<Note>
    Item variants share the same recommendations.

## Set up the deduplication for a model

To deduplicate your recommendations, you must first declare an attribute for distinguishing variants, then turn on deduplication when configuring a Recommend model.
After that, verify that the recommendations have been deduplicated.

### Configure an attribute for distinguishing variants

First, choose which attribute defines records as variants:

1. Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/recommend) and select your Algolia application.
1. On the left sidebar, select ![Recommend icon](/images/recommend-product-icon.svg) **Recommend**.
1. On the [**Configuration**](<%= dashboard_link('explorer/configuration/deduplication-and-grouping') %>) tab, go to the **Deduplication and Grouping** page.
1. In the **Attribute for Distinct** box, select or enter the attribute name you want to use to define variants.

<Note>
    Only use the `distinct` option if you also want to [deduplicate search results](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/grouping/#introducing-algolias-distinct-feature).
</Note>

### Enable Recommend deduplication on your model

1. Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/recommend) and select your Algolia application.
1. On the left sidebar, select ![Recommend icon](/images/recommend-product-icon.svg) **Recommend**.
1. Create a new Recommend model or edit an existing one for the index you used when setting the `attributeForDistinct`.
1. In the section **Distinct and deduplication of recommendations**, select the **Deduplicate recommendations** option. The attribute you selected for defining variants is shown.
1. Continue to configure your Recommend model and click **Save**.

### Verify the recommendations

To check that the deduplication is working for your recommendations, revisit the model configuration once the training process has finished:

1. Go to the **Preview** section.
1. Use the **Search for a record** box to search for an item that _should_ have variants.

This displays the list of recommendations for the selected item.
They shouldn't contain any variants.

## Examples

The following examples illustrate how Recommend deduplication works.
The index has records for T-shirts in different colors and sizes:

- One **red** T-shirt in one size _(XS)_
- Two **green** T-shirts in two sizes _(S, M)_
- Three **blue** T-shirts in three sizes _(L, XL, XXL)_

This example uses the [**Related Items** model](/guides/algolia-recommend/overview/#recommend-models) to recommend the top three similar items with and without deduplication (with the `color` attribute configured as `attributeForDistinct`).

### Without deduplication

Without deduplication, recommendations include variants, such as **blue** _(XXL)_ or **green** _(M)_, except for the **red** T-shirt which doesn't have any.

| Base item       | Recommendation 1 | Recommendation 2 | Recommendation 3 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **red** _(XS)_  | **green** _(S)_  | **blue** _(L)_   | **blue** _(XL)_  |
| **green** _(S)_ | **green** _(M)_  | **red** _(XS)_   | **blue** _(L)_   |
| **blue** _(L)_  | **blue** _(XL)_  | **blue** _(XXL)_ | **green** _(M)_  |

### With deduplication

With deduplication, the recommendations don't include any variants.
However, since this example dataset only includes three records, it can only generate two recommendations.
If you introduce a new item, such as an **orange** T-shirt, it will be added as a third recommendation.

| Base item       | Recommendation 1 | Recommendation 2 | Recommendation 3 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **red** _(XS)_  | **green** _(S)_  | **blue** _(L)_   | Doesn't apply    |
| **green** _(S)_ | **red** _(XS)_   | **blue** _(L)_   | Doesn't apply    |
| **blue** _(L)_  | **red** _(XS)_   | **green** _(M)_  | Doesn't apply    |
