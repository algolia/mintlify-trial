  Learn how to retrieve related items based on images with Recommend's Looking Similar model.
---

_Looking Similar_ is a Recommend model which finds related items based on images in your index.
You can set it up in a few minutes as it doesn't need any events.

Image-based recommendations help inspire your users and let them explore your catalog.
In particular, the Recommend Looking Similar model helps in these cases:

- **When your users know what they want**

  Users might want something specific that isn't available, like an out-of-stock product.
  You can recommend similar-looking alternatives to help users continue their shopping.

- **When users don't know what they want**

  Use recommendations from the Looking Similar model to inspire users to explore your catalog.
  Navigating through similar-looking products can be a great way to discover new products which they might never search for.

- **When you have other ideas**

  The Looking Similar model is a catalog analysis tool that can generate hundreds of recommendations for each item.
  If you combine the recommendations with the Recommend Filtering API,
  you can refine them based on attribute, such as `category == "Clothing"` or `price >= 10`, and enable advanced merchandising.

## Limitations

The model has the following limitations:

- Maximum **3** attributes with images
- Maximum **500,000** images per training (the model will fetch up to this limit,
  sorted by relevance based on your [custom ranking](/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/))
- It can't use [Recommend Rules](https://dashboard.algolia.com/recommend/rules).

        from attributes with several values, such as `rentalHomeImages`, or from several attributes,
        such as `productImage`, `userProvidedProductImage`.
