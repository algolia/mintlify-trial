  Learn how Recommend rules let you refine and curate your recommendations.

Recommend rules are _if_-_then_ statements that let you refine and curate your recommendations without editing code.
When a **condition** (_if_) is met, the rule's **consequences** (_then_) are applied to the recommendations.

The number of rules you can apply to a recommendation scenario depends on your [Algolia plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).

  Recommend rules (full course)

## Examples

Examples for rules include:

- Show related items from the same category as the viewed product.
  Create a rule "Boost items" as consequence,
  where you select the category attribute and the `sameAsViewedItem` value.
  This doesn't exclude recommendations with different categories,
  which can be helpful if you have categories with only few recommendations.

- Exclude recommendations for out-of-stock products.
  For example, if your index has an `inventory` attribute as count,
  you can create a rule with "Filter items" as consequence,
  where you select `inventory > 0` as filter condition.
  This excludes all recommendations with 0 or undefined inventory.

- Curate recommendations by pinning them.
  For example, if you want to make best sellers or newly launched items show up first as recommendations,
  create a rule with the "Pin items" consequence and select specific items and their position in the list of recommendations.

- For all products from a specific category, boost items of a specific type.
  For example, in the category "hair" (`category:hair`), recommend all shampoos (`product_type:shampoo`) first.
  Create a rule with the "Subset of source items" condition and select "`category` is `hair`".
  Add a "Boost items" consequence with "`product_type` is `shampoo`".

## Add rules to recommendations

1. Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/recommend) and select your Algolia application.
1. On the left sidebar, select ![Recommend icon](/images/recommend-product-icon.svg) **Recommend**.
1. On the [**Rules**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/recommend/rules) page,
   select the index and model to which you want to apply rules.

    <Note>
        You can apply rules to trained Frequently Bought Together and Related Product models.
    </Note>

1. Click **+ New rule** and select the conditions when the rule should apply.

   - **Any item is a source item.** The consequences of this rule apply to all recommendations.
   - **Specific item is viewed.** The consequences of this rule apply only when recommendations for a specific item are retrieved.
   - **Subset of source items.** The consequences of this rule apply to items that match a filter.

1. Optional: add a context for this rule.
   Contexts are additional constraints for rules.
   For more information, see [Context-only rules](/guides/managing-results/rules/rules-overview/#context-only-rules).

1. Under **Consequence(-s)**, click **Add consequence** and select what to do when the conditions are met:

    - **Pin items**. Put one or more selected items at a specific position in the list of recommendations (`1` is first)
    - **Hide items**. Exclude one or more selected items from the list of recommendations.
    - **Boost items**. Enter filter criteria and show matching items before non-matching items in the list of recommendations.
    - **Bury items**. Enter filter criteria and show matching items after non-matching items in the list of recommendations.
    - **Filter items**. Enter filter criteria and only include matching items in the list of recommendations.

    To only show items with the same attribute value as the viewed item, set the value to `sameAsViewedItem`.

1. Optional: add a description for the rule and select a timeframe, when the rule should be active.

## Rules precedence algorithm

Algolia uses the following tie-breaking algorithm to determine which rules should apply first:

1. Rules for which you've specified a context.
1. Rules with **Filter items**, **Boost items**, or **Bury items** consequences.
1. Rules with a specified validity time frame.
1. If there are still tied rules, the one with the lowest object ID (alphabetically ordered) wins.
