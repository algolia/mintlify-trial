Your users almost certainly use at least one of YouTube, Amazon, and Facebook.
An essential feature that these sites share is great search.
This is because they have hundreds or thousands of people working on it full-time.

Because your users are constantly exposed to a great search experience on these platforms, they expect to find it on every site and app they use.
But your company isn't a search company:
**it doesn't make sense for you to hire a dedicated team of developers to reinvent search.**

Algolia provides software and tools to help you implement an **efficient, flexible, and insightful search experience on your sites and apps.**

## What does Algolia do?

Algolia consists of two parts: **search implementation** and **search analytics**.
The implementation tools make it easier for your developers to create and maintain great search experiences for your users.
The analytics tools enable your business teams to analyze the impact of those experiences and refine them, so they can directly address your evolving business objectives.

## Search as a feedback loop

Search has the power to both aid and reshape your business.

Although search doesn't know the direction that business should take, it can help you **gather about what your users want, so you can better align your business with your users.**

What if you could ask every customer who enters your store, "What are you looking for?" and automatically record their answers?
This would give you a sense of what they want, what they're not interested in, and how this overlaps with what you provide.

**Algolia lets you immediately start collecting this information about your users.**

## What can Algolia do for my users?

Algolia provides your users with a fast and rich search experience. Your Algolia search interface can contain a search box, filters, infinite scrolling, query suggestions, sorting, refinements, and so on.
These help your users **find what they're looking for** and **discover new products**.
