## Gathering user data

The first step to an effective Personalization implementation is gathering the right data about your users.
When your users engage in specific behaviors, you need to send Algolia events describing these behaviors.
Algolia then uses these events to build individual user affinity profiles.
Before beginning to send events, it's best to analyze which behaviors your users take and creating a plan for the corresponding events you'll send.

### User behaviors are meaningful for your objectives

- You've made a comprehensive list of behaviors your users take that signal their affinities.
- You've [classified behaviors as `view`, `click`, or `conversion`](/guides/send-events/concepts/event-types).
- You've [classified behaviors as search-related or not](/guides/send-events/concepts/event-types).
- You've [classified behaviors as item-based or category-based](/guides/send-events/guides/plan).
- You've selected consistent event names.

### Events capture all necessary information

- All your events include a unique `userToken` for the user engaging in the behavior.
- You are using [`view`, `click`, and `conversion` events](/guides/send-events/concepts/event-types) for the appropriate behavior.
- All your events include a valid `eventName`.
- All your events include the index name where you've declared the [applicable facets](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/configuring-personalization/#weighting-facets-for-personalization) as `attributesForFaceting`.
- If you're sending events related to a search, you've included the `queryID`.
- If you're sending item-based events, you've included the relevant `objectID`.
- If you're sending category or filter-based events, you've included the relevant `filters`.
- Optional but recommended: you've included the `timestamp` for when the behavior occurred.

For more information, see the [Insights API reference](https://www.algolia.com//doc/rest-api/insights/).

You can use the [Insights log debugger](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/debugger) in your dashboard to monitor the received events and ensure that none of them are missing fields or returning errors.

## Configuring your Personalization strategy

The Personalization strategy drives how Algolia computes user affinity profiles using the events you sent.
You can [configure the Personalization strategy directly from your Algolia dashboard](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/configuring-personalization) or using an API client.
However, you should use the dashboard since it provides a visual simulator to explain your strategy's effects.

### Personalization strategy

- You've [included and weighted events](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/configuring-personalization/#weighting-events-for-personalization) in your strategy.
- You're sending the events that you chose in the strategy. You can see the events received during the last 90 days in the [**Personalization** section](https://dashboard.algolia.com/personalization/strategy) of the dashboard.
- You've [included and weighted facets](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/configuring-personalization/#weighting-facets-for-personalization) in your strategy. To select facets for the strategy, you need to first [declare the attributes as facets](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/how-to/declaring-attributes-for-faceting).
- You're sending events related to the facets you chose in the strategy.
- You've set a non-zero [Personalization impact](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/configuring-personalization/#defining-personalization-impact). You can set the Personalization impact at the app level in your Personalization dashboard, or with the `personalizationImpact` search parameter, at query time.

### Strategy simulation

You've [used the simulator](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/configuring-personalization/#simulating-personalization) in the dashboard's [**Personalization** section](https://dashboard.algolia.com/personalization/strategy) to simulate your strategy for various users and queries. The personalized results are as you would expect.

## Enabling personalization on searches

Personalized searches build on a user's affinity profile to boost search results related to their preferences.
It's best to use the API clients or InstantSearch to perform searches.

### `enablePersonalization` and `userToken` are set in your search requests

- You've set `enablePersonalization` to `true` either as a search parameter or in the index configuration.
- You're using consistent user tokens in events and searches. To have personalized results, you must use the same `'userToken` for the events you send for a particular user and the searches that user makes.

<Note>
    If you haven't sent events for a particular user token in the last 90 days, Algolia doesn't personalize that user's results.

## Next steps

Before enabling Personalization for all your users, it's best to [A/B test your Personalization implementation](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/going-to-production/ab-testing-personalization) first.
