AI Personalization can help deliver personalized results to your users, but neglecting to address issues can lead to diminished user satisfaction and adverse business outcomes.

This guide addresses specific issues you may encounter when using AI Personalization, their symptoms, and actionable steps to resolving them.
It ensures that AI Personalization delivers accurate and relevant experiences to your users

## Troubleshoot events

### Non-persistent user tokens

User tokens identify users consistently across different sessions, but if these tokens aren't persistent, they may get reset or changed often.
This results in each session or event belonging to a new user rather than the same one.

#### Symptoms

- A [low returning user rate warning](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#low_returning_users_error) appears in the AI Personalization dashboard.
- The dashboard might show user profiles, but they often appear inconsistent.

#### Recommendation

To track user activity, use [persistent user tokens that remain consistent across sessions and events](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/event-implementation/#attach-user-tokens-to-events),
this ensures accurate user profiles are built over time.

### Incorrect objectIDs

All events must send object IDs that match object IDs in your index's records.
If they don't match, AI Personalization can't accurately link user behavior to the relevant data, leading to problems with how events and indices are associated.

#### Symptoms

- The [User Timeline](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/timeline/) displays events connected to "deleted records" which suggests there are mismatched object IDs.
- Errors such as [mismatched object IDs](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#mismatched_object_ids_error) and
[no object IDs](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#no_object_ids_error) occur when saving the configuration.

#### Recommendation

Ensure all events contain valid object IDs that match the records in your index.
This match is essential for creating accurate and complete user profiles.

### Batch event processing

While processing events in batches isn't an issue, using the same or adjusted timestamps can cause problems.
It can distort the calculation of session duration and result in inaccurate user profiles.

#### Symptoms

- The quality of user profiles generated is poor.

<Note>
    No obvious errors or warnings appear in the dashboard, making this issue harder to detect.
</Note>

#### Recommendation

Avoid manually changing timestamps to get around API checks.
Make sure each event in a session has a unique timestamp that shows the actual time of the user action.

### Incorrect event mapping

Sometimes, user events aren't properly assigned to the correct [event collection](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/events/#event-collections).
Because of this inaccurate mapping, AI Personalization can't properly interpret user behavior, which affects how well it can generate accurate user profiles.

#### Symptoms

- The quality of user profiles generated is poor because AI Personalization can't accurately understand user behavior.
- Conversion rates or other key metrics might seem inaccurate because important events might be underrepresented or overemphasized.

#### Recommendation

Review the [event mapping](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/configuration/events) to make sure user events are categorized according to the recommended event collections.
This ensures that each stage of user interaction is accurately captured and analyzed.

### Obsolete events

If you changed your events implementation to include specific subtypes like `addToCart` and `purchase`, but the configuration has outdated events, this can cause issues.
AI Personalization expects these outdated events, leading to configuration errors.

#### Symptoms

- An [invalid events mapping warning](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#low_returning_users_error) shows up when the configuration is saved indicating that AI Personalization is searching for outdated events.

#### Recommendation

Update the [event mapping](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/configuration/events) by replacing the outdated events with the new ones that include subtypes.
Then, save the configuration to apply the changes.

### Incomplete event collection

If only events related to search activities are collected, while other interactions, like clicks on the home page, are ignored, this can cause issues.
Event collection is incomplete, leading to user profiles based on partial data and poor quality.

#### Symptoms

- User profiles are poor quality because they're created only from search-related activities without considering other interactions.

#### Recommendation

Make sure to capture and map all user interactions, not just those related to search.
Gathering complete event data ensures more accurate and effective personalization.

## Troubleshoot indices

### Excessive affinities

When user profiles have many affinity values, such as multiple product categories or brands linked to one user, it can cause problems.
This excess information may reduce the accuracy of personalization, making it less effective.

#### Symptoms

- Search results are less relevant because AI Personalization struggles to rank the most important affinities.
- Highly relevant affinities may be overshadowed by the overwhelming number of less relevant affinities.
- Decline in A/B test performance, with personalized results failing to show significant improvement compared to non-personalized results.

#### Recommendation

Limit the number of affinity values in user profiles to include only the most relevant data.
This ensures more focused and accurate search results.

### Using SKU attributes as affinities

SKU attributes are specific details for individual products.
When these attributes are used as affinities, it causes issues because [affinities should be categorical](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/index-structure/#use-categorical-attributes), like product categories or brands.
Since SKU attributes are unique, [AI Personalization ignores them](//guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/index-structure/#how-ai-personalization-validates-attributes),
rendering them ineffective as [attributes for affinities](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices/#select-the-attributes-for-affinities).

#### Symptoms

- The SKU-based affinities aren't included in the user profiles generated.

#### Recommendation

Use categorical attributes for affinities instead of specific SKUs.

### Attributes with filter-only modifier

When attributes with the `filterOnly` modifier are used as affinities, it causes an issue.
AI Personalization relies on faceting to handle affinities, but attributes with this modifier don't support faceting.
This means AI Personalization can't process these attributes accurately.

#### Symptoms

- Attributes with the `filterOnly` modifier aren't available for selection as attributes for affinities when personalizing an index.

#### Recommendation

Use the [dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer/configuration/facets) to confirm if an attribute is `filterOnly` and avoid adding it as an attribute for affinities.

## Troubleshoot search results

### Missing user tokens

AI Personalization requires a `userToken` to provide personalized results.
Without it, your search experience can't be tailored to individual users.

#### Symptoms

- Search results aren't personalized, even though user profiles are visible in the dashboard.
- The AI Personalization dashboard shows errors or warnings indicating that user tokens are missing.

#### Recommendation

Ensure that the user token is included in all search queries.
Ensure that the `enablePersonalization` flag has been activated with the [index settings in the dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer/configuration/personalization).

### Mismatched or non-persistent user tokens

If your user tokens don't persist across sessions or don't match the tokens used when sending events.
This can lead to issues with the personalization of search results.

#### Symptoms

- Personalization is applied inconsistently, causing some searches to display personalized results while others don't.
- A/B test results may be unreliable, as the control and variant groups may not show the expected differences, signifying an A/A test scenario.
- The AI Personalization dashboard shows warnings such as [low queries profile applied](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#low_queries_profile_applied_warning),
[low queries profile found](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#low_queries_profile_found_warning),
[low users profile applied](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#low_users_profile_applied_warning),
and [low users profile found](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/error-codes/#low_users_profile_found_warning).

#### Recommendation

Ensure that [user tokens from search queries match sent events](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/event-implementation/#attach-user-tokens-to-events) and
[user tokens are persisted](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#persistent-user-token) (including anonymous user tokens).


### Ranking criteria issue

When the [ranking criteria](/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/#the-ranking-criteria) applied to search results are too narrow, it leaves little room for personalization to affect the outcome.
This can happen if the ranking criteria limits results to a specific set, such as a single product or category.

#### Symptoms

- User profiles are generated and appear in the dashboard.
- The AI Personalization dashboard doesn't display any errors or warnings.
- The [Search Simulator](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/search/) shows little to no change in search result rankings, even when personalization is enabled and different user profiles are chosen.

#### Recommendation

Broaden the ranking criteria to allow personalization to influence the search results more effectively.
This ensures that personalized affinities can alter the ranking of search results.

## Troubleshoot A/B tests

### Premature A/B tests


If A/B tests are stopped prematurely, typically after a couple of days, it can lead to unreliable results.

#### Symptoms

- A/B test results show false positives or negatives, with marginal differences in metrics (such as for conversion rates and revenue)
- The test fails to reach statistical significance, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.

#### Recommendation

Run A/B tests for at least 2-3 weeks or until statistical significance is reached.
This ensures that the results are robust and reflective of actual user behavior.

### Running an A/A test

Both the control and variant groups in your A/B test are receiving the same treatment, typically due to non-persistent tokens or wrongly configured personalization settings.
This leads to both groups being identical, rendering the test ineffective.

#### Symptoms

- The A/B test fails to reach significance, as there is no difference between the control and variant groups.
- Reported metrics may show minimal or no variation, indicating that personalization wasn't properly applied.

#### Recommendation

Verify that personalization is enabled and [user tokens are persisted](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#persistent-user-token) for both the variant and control groups.
This ensures the variant group receives the intended personalization settings.

### Mixing queries with and without personalization

When some search queries in the A/B test variant have personalization enabled while others don't, it creates inconsistency.
This skews the results, making it difficult to measure the true impact of personalization.

#### Symptoms

- The A/B test results are inconsistent, with some queries showing personalization effects while others don't.
- The number of queries analyzed may be much lower than the typical traffic, indicating that queries aren't properly configured for personalization.

#### Recommendation

Ensure that personalization is enabled for all queries in both the control and variant groups.
Use [persistent user tokens](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#persistent-user-token) across all queries to maintain consistency in the test.
