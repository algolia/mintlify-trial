<Beta />

AI Personalization relies on valid, relevant, and well-structured Insights events to generate accurate user profiles.
When you [configure AI Personalization](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices), your [Insights events](/guides/send-events/get-started) and search queries are checked to ensure they meet specific requirements.
If they don't, a combination of the following errors and warnings will be returned.

You must resolve any errors before continuing to configure AI Personalization.

## Application errors

Enabling AI Personalization on an application can sometimes cause it to enter a `paused` state with the following errors.

### Application blocked

**code:** `blocked`

The application has been blocked and can't use AI Personalization.
Contact the [Algolia support team](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance. 

### Application deleted

**code:** `deleted`

The application has been deleted and is no longer available within Algolia.

### Unauthorized application

**code:** `no_perso_access`

The application no longer has access to AI Personalization.
To verify this, visit the [AI Personalization dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization).
If needed, contact your Algolia application administrator to request access to AI Personalization.

### Missing attributes

**code:** `all_attr_value_filtered`

For the personalized indices in this application, AI Personalization couldn't identify any attributes suitable for generating affinities.

### No application events

**code:** `no_events_last_30_days`

AI Personalization couldn't find any events from the last 30 days for your personalized indices.
Make sure you're [capturing all relevant events](/guides/send-events/get-started) for your search and discovery process.
If the error persists after checking your setup, contact the [Algolia support team](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.

### Missing index

**code:** `missing_index`

The personalized index is no longer available within Algolia.

### Invalid configuration

**code:** `invalid_config`

The configuration associated with this app doesn't meet the [AI Personalization requirements](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/#before-you-begin).
Verify that you properly configured [indices](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices) and [user events](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/events).

### Pending pipelines

**code:** `pending_pipelines`

AI Personalization is unable to process this application.
We've been notified and are working to resolve the issue.
If the issue persists, contact the [Algolia support team](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.

### All facets invalid

**code:** `all_facets_invalid`

The [attributes selected for affinities](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices/#select-the-attributes-for-affinities) in your AI Personalization configuration are invalid.
Ensure that your [index structure is correctly prepared](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/index-structure) for AI Personalization.

## Index errors

The following errors will be returned if the indices you want to enable AI Personalization on don't meet the requirements.

### Missing index

**code:** `no_index`

An index in your configuration doesn't exist in your app.
Ensure that the name of the index is spelled correctly _or_ [configure AI Personalization in the dashboard](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices) so you only select indices that exist.

### Missing records

**code:** `no_records`

An index in your configuration doesn't contain any records.
[Review your indices](https://dashboard.algolia.com/indices) to ensure you are configuring the correct index.
If the index you intend to use contains no records, [send data to the index](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data).

## Events errors

The following errors will be returned if the events for the indices you want to enable AI Personalization on don't meet the requirements.

Use the [Events Debugger](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/debugger) to monitor and debug the 3,000 most recent events.

<Note>
    AI Personalization only checks [valid Insights events](/guides/send-events/guides/validate) with `objectIDs` that were received by Algolia in the past 24 hours.
    Events with `filters` are not used.
</Note>
When a primary or replica index is selected in the configuration, events for the primary index and its replicas are combined and then validated altogether.

### Invalid events mapping

**code:** `invalid_events_mapping`

Some events in the [`eventsMapping`](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/configuration/events/) don't exist.
Ensure the names and types of the events are spelled correctly _or_ [use the dashboard to configure AI Personalization](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/events).

### Mismatched object IDs

**code:** `mismatched_object_ids`

Less than 80% of events for this index and its replicas, that have an `objectID`, correspond to a record in the primary index with a matching `objectID`.
[Review the index](https://dashboard.algolia.com/indices) and ensure you aren't sending events for objects that don't exist in the primary index, were recently deleted from the index, or exist in another primary index.

### Missing events

**code:** `no_events`

No events exist for this index or its replicas.
Ensure you are [capturing all important events](/guides/send-events/get-started) related to your search and discovery experience.

### Missing user tokens

**code:** `no_user_tokens`

None of the events in this index or replicas have a `userToken`.
Ensure you are [sending a valid `userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token) for all events.

### Unique user tokens

**code:** `single_user_token`

All the events for this index or replicas have the same `userToken`.
Ensure you are [sending a unique `userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/usert-oken#persistent-user-token) for each user.

### Invalid user tokens

**code:** `undefined_user_tokens`

All the events for this index or replicas have a `userToken` of `undefined`, `anonymous`, or `''`.
Ensure you are [sending a unique `userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token#persistent-user-token) for each user.

### Missing object IDs

**code:** `no_object_ids`

Some of the received events for this index and its replicas don't have `objectIDs`.
Ensure you are sending events with `objectIDs`.

### Low number of returning users

**code:** `low_returning_users`

Less than 1% of user tokens appear in events on consecutive days.
If this is unexpected, check that you've [implemented persistent user tokens](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#algolia-cookie).
If this matches your expectations, implement a strategy to get more users regularly returning to your site.

## Events warnings

To ensure the most accurate user profiles, avoid the following warnings related to your events.
Fixing them isn't mandatory but can be helpful.

### Missing user tokens

**code:** `some_events_with_no_user_tokens`

Some, but not all, of the events for this index or replicas have no `userToken`.
Ensure you are [sending a valid `userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token) for every event.

### Invalid user tokens

**code:** `some_events_with_undefined_user_tokens`

Some, but not all, of the events for this index or replicas have a `userToken` of `undefined`, `anonymous`, or `''`.
Ensure you are [sending a unique `userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token#persistent-user-token) for every user.

### Low number of events with object IDs

**code:** `low_object_ids`

Some, but not all, of the events for this index or replicas don't contain `objectIDs`.
Ensure you are [sending events with `objectIDs`](/guides/send-events/concepts/event-types/#events-by-features).

### No event subtypes

**code:** `no_event_subtypes`

Received conversion events lack either `addToCart` or `purchase` subtypes.
Ensure you are sending [valid subtypes](/guides/send-events/concepts/event-types) for all conversion events.

### Low number of returning users

**code:** `low_returning_users`

Less than 10% of user tokens appear in events on consecutive days.
If this is unexpected, check that you've [implemented persistent user tokens](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#algolia-cookie).
If this matches your expectations, implement a strategy to get more users regularly returning to your site.

## Query errors

The following errors will be returned when the requirements for search queries haven't been met.

<Note>
    AI Personalization only checks search queries that were received by Algolia in the past 24 hours.
</Note>

When a primary or replica index is selected in the configuration, queries for the primary index and its replicas are combined and validated altogether.

### No users

**code:** `no_users`

In the past 24 hours, none of your users have searched your personalized index.
Ensure you've correctly [configured the index for personalization](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices).

### No queries

**code:** `no_queries`

In the past 24 hours, none of your search queries targeted your personalized index. 
Ensure you've correctly [configured the index for personalization](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices).

### Missing queries with personalization enabled

**code:** `no_queries_perso_enabled`

None of your search queries have personalization enabled:

- Review your index settings under **Index > Configuration > Personalization** and ensure you are setting the `enablePersonalization` parameter to `true`.
You can also set this parameter while creating an A/B test or send it as a query parameter to the search API.
- Add the `userToken` parameter to search API requests.

### Missing users with personalization enabled

**code:** `no_users_perso_enabled`

Search personalization is not enabled for any users.
This check is similar to [missing queries with personalization enabled](#no_queries_perso_enabled_error), but verifies the unique user tokens received by the search API.

### Missing queries with profile found

**code:** `no_queries_profile_found`

None of your search queries are associated with a user profile.
Ensure that you are [sending a valid `userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token),
users are assigned a [persistent user token](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#persistent-user-token) across sessions and that user tokens sent to the search API match user tokens from Insights events.

### Missing users with personalized queries

**code:** `no_users_profile_found`

None of your users profiles are found for search queries.
This check is similar to [missing queries with profile found](#no_queries_profile_found_error), but verifies the unique user tokens received by the search API.

### Missing queries with personalization applied

**code:** `no_queries_profile_applied`

None of your search queries have been re-ranked by personalization.
Ensure the attributes in your index match the affinities in the user profiles, so records that match the profile can be boosted.

### Missing users with personalization applied

**code:** `no_users_profile_applied`

None of your users had search queries with records boosted by personalization.
This check is similar to [missing queries with personalization applied](#no_queries_profile_applied_error), but verifies the unique user tokens received by the search API.

## Queries warnings

To ensure the highest impact of personalization on search results, resolve the following warnings related to your search queries.
Fixing them isn't mandatory but can be helpful.

### Low number of queries with personalization enabled
**code:** `low_queries_perso_enabled`

Only a subset of your queries have personalization enabled:

- Review your index settings under **Index > Configuration > Personalization** and ensure you are setting the `enablePersonalization` parameter to `true`.
You can also set this parameter while creating an A/B test or send it as a query parameter to the search API.
- Add the `userToken` parameter to search API requests.

### Low number of users with personalization enabled

**code:** `low_users_perso_enabled`

Only a subset of your users have search personalization enabled.
This check is similar to [low number of queries with personalization enabled](#low_queries_perso_enabled_warning), but verifies the unique user tokens received by the search API.

### Low number of queries with personalization found

**code:** `low_queries_profile_found`

Only a subset of your queries are associated with a user profile.
Ensure that you are [sending a valid `userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token),
users are assigned a [persistent user token](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#persistent-user-token) across sessions and that user tokens sent to the search API match user tokens from Insights events.

### Low number of users with personalization found

**code:** `low_users_profile_found`

Only a subset of your users profiles are found for search queries.
This check is similar to [low number of queries with personalization found](#low_queries_profile_found_warning), but verifies the unique user tokens received by the search API.

### Low number of queries with personalization applied

**code:** `low_queries_profile_applied`

Only a subset of your queries can be re-ranked by personalization. Ensure that user profiles have more than one or two affinities, so they can be matched with records attributes to boost them in search results.

### Low number of users with personalization applied

**code:** `low_users_profile_applied`

Only a subset of your users had search queries with records that can be boosted by personalization.
This check is similar to [low number of queries with personalization applied](#low_queries_profile_applied_warning), but verifies the unique user tokens received by the search API.


## Attribute errors

### Ignored regex

**code:** `ignored_regex`

This attribute uses a reserved name such as `objectID`.
Ensure that none of the attributes in your index uses a reserved name.

### No values

**code:** `no_values`

You don't have any values for this attribute in your index.
Ensure that every record in your index has a value for this attribute.

### All invalid values

**code:** `all_invalid_values`

All records in your index have an invalid value for this attribute.
Common examples of invalid values include `unknown`, `Unknown`, `""`, `***`, `{}`, `n/a`, `N/A`, `NULL`, `null` or `not-set`.
Ensure all invalid values are removed from your index for this attribute.

### Numerical type

**code:** `numerical_type`

This attribute is numerical across your index, making it less suitable as a categorical attribute.
Ensure you [use categorical attributes](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/index-structure/#use-categorical-attributes) when configuring AI Personalization.

### Mostly invalid values

**code:** `mostly_invalid_values`

Most of the values for this attribute in the index are invalid. Common examples of invalid values include `unknown`, `Unknown`, `""`, `***`, `{}`, `n/a`, `N/A`, `NULL`, `null` or `not-set`.
Ensure all invalid values are removed from your index for this attribute.

### Excessive unique values

**code:** `excessive_unique_values`

Most values for this attribute in the index are unique, indicating it is not truly categorical.
Ensure you [use categorical attributes](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/index-structure/#use-categorical-attributes) when configuring AI Personalization.

### Single unique value

**code:** `single_unique_value`

All values for this attribute in the index are identical, but AI Personalization requires at least two categories.
Ensure your index includes at least two distinct values for this attribute.
