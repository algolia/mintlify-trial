A/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, compares two versions of a web page, app, or other product to decide which one performs better.

With AI Personalization, A/B testing involves comparing two versions of search results.
These search results are based on the effect of the [personalization re-ranking level you set](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/personalization-reranking).

By conducting an A/B test, you can find the ideal level of personalization that suits your business and allows you to maximize user engagement and satisfaction.

## Before your begin
