<Beta />

AI Personalization creates a profile for each user based on how they use your website or app.

## Benefits

AI Personalization offers several advantages:

- **It's easier to set up.**
AI Personalization automates and, hence, speeds up the deployment of a personalization strategy.

- **It generates unbiased user profiles.**
Classic Personalization can lead to biased or inconsistent user profiles. By automating the process, AI Personalization helps eliminate these biases.

- **It predicts user preferences.**
AI Personalization can predict [what users might like or dislike](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/how-does-ai-personalization-work/#understanding-user-profiles). This means it can better customize the experience for each user based on their unique tastes.

- **It generates more accurate user profiles.**
AI Personalization generates user profiles based on [signals from your users](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/how-does-ai-personalization-work/#translating-user-behavior-into-affinities-through-events). The stronger the signals, the more accurate it can be in understanding each user.

- **It enhances monitoring and testing.**
You can use the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/overview) to inspect your user profiles, simulate search personalization experiences, or [conduct A/B tests](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/ab-test/).

## Considerations

Before choosing to migrate from [Classic Personalization](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/what-is-personalization/) to AI Personalization, you need to consider the following:

- **AI Personalization deactivates Classic Personalization.** You won't be able to update your Classic Personalization setup.
This includes, your strategy, `facets` and `personalizationImpact`.
- **Your events and index data are unchanged by the migration.**
- **User profiles stop personalizing search results**. Classic Personalization will stop personalizing search results for already generated user profiles until your AI Personalization setup is complete.

- **Migration can be rolled back during beta.** To revert to Classic Personalization, contact the [Algolia support team](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) team.
By rolling back the migration, you will lose all changes made in AI Personalization.
