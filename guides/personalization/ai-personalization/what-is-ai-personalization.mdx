## Advantages of personalization

Think of Algolia's AI Personalization as a tool to create personalized experiences for your users as they use your website or app.

For example, a user searching for "apple" and is interested in technology likely wants to see "Apple Inc" at the top of their search results, while users who have a keen interest in cooking may be more interested in seeing "Apple Recipes" in their results.

Better [relevance](/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/) reduces the effort users need to invest in finding what they want.
