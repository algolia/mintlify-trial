To make personalization work well, you need to properly set up your index data, track user events, and implement search features
After you have these basics ready, you can begin setting up personalization to customize search results for your users.

## Before you begin

Before setting up personalization, you need to address the following requirements:

1. [Prepare your index](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/index-structure)
1. [Prepare your events](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/event-implementation)
1. [Prepare your search implementation](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/search-implementation)

## Setup personalization

Once you've prepared your index data, user events and search implementation, you can set up personalization on the dashboard:

1. [Configure indices to personalize](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices)
1. [Configure user events](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/events)
1. [Set personalization re-ranking](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/personalization-reranking)

Alternatively, you can use the AI Personalization API to set up personalization.
