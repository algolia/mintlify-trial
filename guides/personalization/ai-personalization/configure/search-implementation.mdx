Once you've [prepared your event implementation](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/event-implementation/), focus on your search implementation.

## Attach user tokens to queries

To ensure that AI Personalization can understand each user's journey and continuously improve their personalization experience, attach a user token to each query.
The user tokens attached to the queries must match the user tokens sent with events.

### Attach user tokens with InstantSearch

To include the `userToken` in your search queries using InstantSearch, use the `configure` widget to set the `userToken` search parameter.

<CodeGroup>

```js InstantSearch.js
instantsearch.widgets.configure({
    userToken: 'user-1234',
});
```

```vue Vue InstantSearch
<ais-configure userToken="user-1234" />
```

```jsx React InstantSearch
<Configure userToken="user-1234" />
```

```ios InstantSearch iOS
searcher.request.query.userToken = 'user-1234'
```

```kotlin InstantSearch Android
searcher.query.userToken = 'user-1234'
```

```dart Algolia for Flutter
final hitsSearcher = HitsSearcher.create(
    applicationID: 'YourApplicationID',
    apiKey: 'YourSearchOnlyApiKey',
    state: const SearchState(userToken: 'user-1234'),
);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Attach user tokens with an API client

To include the `userToken` in your search queries with an API client, use the `search` method to send the `userToken` search parameter.

<CodeGroup>
```csharp C#
Query query = new Query("query");
query.UserToken = "user-1234";
```

```php PHP
$index->search('query', [
    'userToken' => 'user-1234'
]);
```

```js JavaScript
index.search('query', {
    userToken: 'user-1234'
}).then(({ hits }) => {
    console.log(hits);
});
```

```python Python
index.search('query', {'userToken': 'user-1234'});
```

```ruby Ruby
index.search('query', { userToken: 'user-1234' })
```

```java Java
Query query = new Query("query")
.setUserToken("user-1234");
```

```go Go
res, err := index.Search(
    "query",
    opt.UserToken("user-1234"),
)
```

```swift Swift
let query = Query("query")
    .set(\.userToken, to: "user-1234")

index.search(query: query) { result in
    if case .success(let response) = result {
    print("Response: \(response)")
    }
}
```

```scala Scala
client.execute {
    search into "myIndex" query Query(
    query = Some("query"),
    userToken = Some("user-1234")
    )
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Persist user tokens

For user profiles to be found and retrieved at search time, you should [persist anonymous user tokens](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#persistent-user-token) and authenticated user tokens across sessions.

## Avoid enabling personalization at query time

Rather than using the `enablePersonalization` search parameter at query time, set it in the index settings when moving to production.
This lets you [A/B test the impact of personalization](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/ab-test) without having to modify code.

## Next steps

Now that you've [prepared your index structure](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/index-structure), [event implementation](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/event-implementation) and search implementation,
AI Personalization can build a holistic view of each user's journey and personalize search results accordingly.

You're ready to [configure AI Personalization indices](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices) without additional code changes.
