Determining the ideal level of [**Personalization Re-Ranking**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/configuration/reranking) for your business is crucial for maximizing user engagement and satisfaction.
AI Personalization offers you the flexibility to adjust how search results are personalized, ensuring that every user's experience is as relevant and engaging as possible.

## Personalization re-ranking levels

Personalization Re-Ranking controls the impact of personalization on boosting records.

Explore the range of personalization levels to find the best match for your search, from lower to higher:

- **None**. Disables personalization, ensuring all users see the same arrangement of search results.
- **Low**. Implements minimal personalization by subtly reordering search results to start aligning with individual user preferences.
- **Medium**. Enhances personalization by adjusting the ranking of search results more noticeably, for a tailored user experience.
- **High**. Amplifies personalization significantly, deeply customizing the order of search results to match user preferences closely.
- **Maximum**. Delivers the ultimate level of personalization, radically transforming the order of search results for optimal relevance to each user.

If Personalization Re-Ranking is set to maximum,
Algolia prioritizes [Personalization over business relevance](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/what-is-personalization/#the-order-of-relevance-strategies) since records boosted by personalization can reach the top position in the textual bucket.

You can [run A/B tests](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/monitor/ab-test) to compare the performance of different levels of personalization re-ranking.
This empirical approach lets you observe the impact on real user interactions, helping you make an informed decision that aligns with your business objectives and user preferences.

## Enable AI Personalization with Personalization re-ranking

[AI Personalization](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/what-is-ai-personalization) uses both [Personalization Re-Ranking](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ai-personalization/configuration/reranking) and `enablePersonalization` to determine how personalization affects your search results.

- If the personalization re-ranking level is set to `None` and `enablePersonalization` is false, AI Personalization won't apply because personalization is off for the index.
- If the personalization re-ranking level is set to anything other than `None` and `enablePersonalization` is false, AI Personalization won't apply. Personalization must be enabled for it to take effect.
- If the personalization re-ranking level is set to `None` and `enablePersonalization` is true, AI Personalization won't apply until you choose a different re-ranking level. 
- If the personalization re-ranking level is set to anything other than `None` and `enablePersonalization` is true, AI Personalization will apply based on the chosen re-ranking level.
