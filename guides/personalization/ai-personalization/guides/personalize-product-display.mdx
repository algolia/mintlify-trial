By showing variants of products that align with user preferences, such as color choices, you can create a more engaging and relevant search experience.
This approach enables users to project themselves into the product and make purchase decisions faster.

## Before you begin

This guide assumes familiarity with React InstantSearch and that your records share similarities, making them eligible for variants.

</Frame>

In this example screenshot, the search results for "iPod Touch" display personalized variants:

- Color variants exist in blue, silver, black, pink, and yellow.
- Each user sees the variant that best matches their color preferences.
- Only one variant per product appears to maintain clean results.
- The system tracks which variant users click to refine future personalization.

## Structure your records

Each product variant should be a separate record, structured with:

- A shared `variantKey` to group related variants.
- A unique `objectID` for tracking interactions.
- Specific variant attributes, such as color and size.

```json JSON
{
  "objectID": "0b7fe760-e3ce-4b58-81e8-6d1537dbc98e",
  "variantName": "iPod Touch 16GB MP3 Player (Blue)",
  "variantKey": "ipod-touch-16gb",
  "name": "iPod Touch 16GB MP3 Player",
  "color": "blue",
  "price": 189.99
}
```

## Configure AI Personalization

In AI Personalization, add the `color` attribute to the [attributes for affinities](/guides/personalization/ai-personalization/configure/indices/#select-the-attributes-for-affinities).

## Configure distinct results

Use the distinct feature to display only one variant per product in search results:

- Set the `attributeForDistinct` parameter with `"variantKey"` in the index settings.
- Configure the `distinct` parameter with the number of variants to show in the search results, either in the index settings or at search time.
