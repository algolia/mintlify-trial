description: |-
  Export and your records and settings from your Algolia index from the dashboard or the API.
---

You can export the configuration of one index and import it in another index.
This can be useful if you want to:

- Back up your index configuration
- Track changes to the index configuration—for example, with a version control system
- Apply the same configuration to multiple indices—for example, moving between staging and production environments,
  or when you have different indices for different geographical regions

If you want to copy an index's settings to another index, see [Copy indices](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/copy-indices/).

## Export records from your indices

You can export the records in your indices as a [JSON](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file using one of these methods:

- Use the [`algolia objects browse`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-objects/#algolia-objects-browse) command with the Algolia CLI
- Use the [`browse`](/api-reference/api-methods/browse/) method with an API client

You can convert the resulting file to other formats like CSV: programmatically or with a JSON conversion tool.

## What's included in the index configuration

Your index configuration includes values for:

- Settings, such as:
  - [Searchable attributes](/guides/managing-results/must-do/searchable-attributes/)
  - [Custom ranking](/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/)
  - [Typo tolerance](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/typo-tolerance/in-depth/configuring-typo-tolerance/)
  - [Stop words](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/how-to/customize-stop-words/)
- [Synonyms](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/)
- [Rules](/guides/managing-results/rules/rules-overview/)

## Export index configuration in the Algolia dashboard

To export the configuration of an index from the Algolia dashboard as a JSON file:

1. Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer/browse) and select your Algolia application.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search**.

1. Select your Algolia index:

1. Select **Manage index > Export Configuration**.

1. Select what you want to export: **Settings**, **Synonyms**, or **Rules**.

1. Click **Export Configuration** to download a JSON file with the index configuration.

## Export index configuration with the Algolia CLI

To export the configuration of an index with the Algolia CLI, run:

```sh sh
algolia indices config export YOUR_INDEX_NAME
```

You can select what you want to export by providing the `--scope` option.
This command saves a JSON file with your index configuration.
You can use this JSON file to [import](#import-index-configuration-in-the-algolia-dashboard)
your index configuration in the dashboard—for example, in another index.

You can also export your settings, rules, and synonyms individually with these commands:

- [`algolia settings get`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-settings/#algolia-settings-get)
- [`algolia rules browse`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-rules/#algolia-rules-browse)
- [`algolia synonyms browse`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-synonyms/#algolia-synonyms-browse)

Check the [Algolia CLI usage examples](/tools/cli/examples/recipes/#export-to-files) for more information.

## Export index configuration with the API

Using the API, you can export the index settings, rules, and synonyms in any format.
To export your settings, rules, and synonyms, you need an API key with [`settings`](/guides/security/api-keys/#access-control-list-acl) permissions.

You can obtain the index configuration with the following methods:

- [`getSettings`](/api-reference/api-methods/get-settings/)
- [`exportRules`](/api-reference/api-methods/export-rules/)
- [`exportSynonyms`](/api-reference/api-methods/export-synonyms/)

## Import index configuration in the Algolia dashboard

1. Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer/browse) and select your Algolia application.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search**.

1. Select your Algolia index:

1. Select **Manage index > Import Configuration**.

1. Select the JSON file you want to import.

1. Choose what you want to import: **Settings**, **Synonyms**, or **Rules**.

1. Type `IMPORT` to confirm and click **Import Configuration**.

   <Warning>
     Importing settings **replaces all existing index settings** with the
     imported ones. Synonyms and rules are replaced if the synonym or rule
     already exists. Otherwise, new synonyms or rules are added.
   </Warning>

   {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Import index configuration with the Algolia CLI

To import the configuration of an index with the Algolia CLI, run:

```sh sh
algolia indices config import YOUR_INDEX_NAME
```

The command asks you which JSON file you want to upload and which scopes (settings, rules, synonyms)
you want to import. The JSON file must be an object with `settings`, `synonyms`, or `rules` keys—for example,
exported from the dashboard or the Algolia CLI.

You can also use these commands to import settings, rules, and synonyms individually:

- [`algolia settings import`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-settings/#algolia-settings-import)
- [`algolia rules import`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-rules/#algolia-rules-import)
- [`algolia synonyms import`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-synonyms/#algolia-synonyms-import)

Check the [Algolia CLI usage examples](/tools/cli/examples/recipes/#import-from-files-or-standard-input) for more information.

## Import index configuration with the API

After importing a file with the index configuration,
you can use these methods to change the configuration.
You need an API key with [`editSettings`](/guides/security/api-keys/#access-control-list-acl) permissions.

You can change the index configuration with the following methods:

- [`setSettings`](/api-reference/api-methods/set-settings/)
- [`saveRule`](/api-reference/api-methods/save-rule/)
- [`saveSynonym`](/api-reference/api-methods/save-synonym/)

  - [Synonyms](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/)
