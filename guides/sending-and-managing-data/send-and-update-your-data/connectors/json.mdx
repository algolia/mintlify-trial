  Index your data from a JSON file you host.

The JSON connector lets you read objects from a JSON file and store them in an Algolia index.

The connector imports a single array of JSON objects as records.
Each record must have a unique identifier to be used as the [object ID](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#unique-object-identifiers) in Algolia.

In the following example, `userID` could serve as the object ID.

```json json
[
  {
    "userID": 1001,
    "firstName": "Marianne",
    "lastName": "Neal"
  },
  {
    "userID": 1002,
    "firstName": "Austin",
    "lastName": "Wolfe"
  }
]
```

## Configure your data source

1. Open the [**Connectors**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors) page in the Algolia dashboard.
1. Select the JSON connector and click **Connect**.
1. Click **Get started**.
1. Select the authentication method:
   - **None** if the file is public.
   - **Basic Auth** if you need a username and password to access the file.
1. Enter the FTP or HTTP URL to your JSON file.
   For HTTP URLs, you can further select whether to fetch the JSON file with a GET or a POST request. This depends on your server.
1. In the **Unique property identifier** field, enter the property of your JSON objects that should serve as unique identifiers for your Algolia records (`objectID`).
1. Enter a name for the source. This helps you distinguish between different sources.
1. Click **Create source**.

## Configure your destination

1. Create a new [Algolia API key](/guides/security/api-keys/)
   or select an existing one for indexing your data.
1. Enter an index name, where the connector should store the records.
   If you enter a name of an existing index, it'll be overwritten.
1. Enter a name for the destination. This helps you distinguish between different destinations.
1. Click **Create destination**.

## Configure your task

1. Select when the connector should fetch your data:
   - **On demand**. The connector only fetches data if you manually run it from the [**Tasks**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors/tasks/).
   - **Scheduled**. The connector runs on a schedule.
     You can select a schedule from the list, or enter a custom schedule with a cron expression.
1. Click **Create task**.
