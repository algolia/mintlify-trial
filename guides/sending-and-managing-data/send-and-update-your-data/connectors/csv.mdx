  Index your data from a CSV file you host.

The CSV connector lets you read rows from a CSV file and store them in an Algolia index.

The connector expects a CSV file where each row represents a record.
Each row must have a unique identifier that Algolia uses as the [object ID](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#unique-object-identifiers).

```csv csv
userID,firstName,lastName
1001,Marianne,Neal
1002,Austin,Wolfe
```
