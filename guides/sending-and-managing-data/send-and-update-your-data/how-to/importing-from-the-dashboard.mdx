  Learn how to index your data from Algolia's dashboard.
---

Using the dashboard, you can either import a file or connect Algolia to a file on your servers.

File importing can be helpful when you're just starting with Algolia and want to test it with sample data. However, you can't use the dashboard to update _existing_ data. To synchronize or update such data, use an [alternative method](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/).

<Note>
  In the dashboard, you can upload files up to 100Â MB. For larger files, consider using the [API, CLI, or the CSV no-code connector](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/) instead.

## Import files

Algolia uses [JSON to model records](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/what-is-in-a-record/) and can import JSON, CSV, and TSV files:

```json json
[
  {
    "firstname": "Jimmie",
    "lastname": "Barninger"
  },
  {
    "firstname": "Warren",
    "lastname": "Speach"
  }
]
```

```csv csv
firstname,lastname
Jimmie,Barninger
Warren,Speach
```

```tsv tsv
"firstname" "lastname"
"Jimmie"    "Barninger"
"Warren"    "Speach"
```

## Create a new index

To create a new index to import your file data into:

1. Go to the [**Indices** tab](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer/browse) in the Algolia dashboard and click **New > Index**.

1. Give your index a name and click **Create**.

## Upload the file

To add records to a new index, click **Upload records > Upload file** to import your file.

To add records to an existing index:

1. Click **Add records > Upload file**.

1. Drop the file into the **Upload records** box or select it on your file system. Then, click **Upload**.

1. Once Algolia has indexed your data, the dashboard will notify you of a successful save.
