  How to structure long pages by splitting them into smaller chunks, by paragraph, page, or any other logical breaking point.
---

To ensure good performance, Algolia limits the [size of each record](/guides/scaling/algolia-service-limits/#application-record-and-index-limits). Long content, like a detailed Wikipedia page, might be too big to fit into one of these records.

To work around this, divide long pages into smaller "chunks". This not only helps you stay within the size limit but also makes your search [more relevant](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/how-to-build-a-helpful-search-for-technical-documentation-the-laravel-example/). Break the page into sections or even paragraphs, and store each as a separate record.

When splitting into chunks, organize them based on the page structure. For instance, if you're dealing with a lengthy Wikipedia article, create separate records for each section like "Introduction" or "History".

<Note>
  If you're using the Algolia Crawler and the [record size exceeds the limit](/tools/crawler/troubleshooting/indexing-issues/#records-exceed-the-maximum-for-your-algolia-plan), use the [`helpers.splitContentIntoRecords()`](/tools/crawler/apis/configuration/actions/#parameter-param-splitcontentintorecords) helper to split the page into smaller chunks.

## Avoid duplicates

When you split a page, the same content might appear in multiple records. By setting the [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) parameter to `true`, Algolia ensures only the most relevant of these duplicate records is shown. You decide what counts as 'distinct' by choosing a meaningful attribute, like the title of a section.

### Example

In the following example, you've structured your records for a long page. To make sure that search results show only one entry per section, you:

- Set `distinct` to `true`
- Choose `section` as your [`attributeForDistinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributeForDistinct/).

The search engine crawls or spiders the web at large, including the client site, and then offers search features restricted to only that target site. This is a large and complex task, available only to large organisations at the scale of Google or Microsoft."

## How to enable the `distinct` feature

You can enable `distinct` from Algolia's dashboard or API.

### Using the API

If using the API to enable 'distinct\`, you can either do it at indexing time (when you add records to your indices) or at query time (when users search).

1. Set an attribute, such as `section`, as the [`attributeForDistinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributeForDistinct/)
1. Set [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) to `true` to deduplicate your results.

#### At indexing time

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings { AttributeForDistinct = "section", Distinct = true, };

  index.SetSettings(settings);

  // Asynchronous
  await index.SetSettingsAsync(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := index.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	opt.AttributeForDistinct("section"),
  	opt.Distinct(true),
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  index.setSettings(
    new IndexSettings()
      .setAttributeForDistinct("section")
      .setDistinct(Distinct.of(true))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  index
    .setSettings({
      attributeForDistinct: "section",
      distinct: true,
    })
    .then(() => {
      // done
    });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val settings = settings {
      attributeForDistinct = Attribute("section")
      distinct = Distinct(1)
  }

  index.setSettings(settings)
  ```

  ```php php
  $index->setSettings([
    'attributeForDistinct' => 'section',
    'distinct' => true
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  index.set_settings({"attributeForDistinct": "section", "distinct": True})
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  index.set_settings(
    {
      attributeForDistinct: "section",
      distinct: true
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "myIndex" `with` IndexSettings(
      attributeForDistinct = Some("section"),
      distinct = Some(true))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  index.setSettings([
    "attributeForDistinct": "section",
    "distinct": true,
  ])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### At query time

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  index.Search<JObject>(new Query("query") { Distinct = true });
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := index.Search("query", opt.Distinct(true))
  ```

  ```java java
  index.search(
          new Query("query").setDistinct(Distinct.of(true))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  index
    .search("query", {
      distinct: true,
    })
    .then(({ hits }) => {
      console.log(hits);
    });
  ```

  ```php php
  $results = $index->search('query', [
    'distinct' => true
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  results = index.search("query", {"distinct": True})
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  results = index.search(
    "query",
    {
      distinct: true
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    search into "myIndex" query Query(
      query = Some("query"),
      distinct = Some(true))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  let query = Query(query: "query")
  query.distinct = true

  index.search(
    query,
    completionHandler: { (res, error) in
      print(res)
    })
  ```
</CodeGroup>
