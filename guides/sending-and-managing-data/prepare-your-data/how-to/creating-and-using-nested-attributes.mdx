  Learn about nested attributes, and when to use them.

With nested attributes, you can add subcategories to your attributes.
For example, instead of having a single attribute `price`, you might set up different prices as subcategories: `price.net`, `price.gross`, `price.margin`.
Use 'dot notation' to separate the parent attribute from its child.

## How to create nested attributes

You can create nested attributes by adding a JSON object to your records when you [send them to Algolia](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/).
For example:

```json json
[
  {
    "country": "CA",
    "price": {
      "net": 2.3,
      "gross": 2.62
    }
  },
  {
    "country": "US",
    "price": {
      "net": 1.99,
      "gross": 1.75
    }
  }
]
```

## An example of filtering nested attributes with an API client

```js js
const index = client.initIndex("your_index_name");

index
  .search("", {
    filters: "country:US AND price.gross < 2.0",
  })
  .then(({ hits }) => {
    console.log(hits);
  });
```

## An example of filtering nested attributes with the Algolia CLI

```sh sh
algolia search --indexName=your_index_name --filters='country:US AND price.gross < 2.0'
```

## Where you can use nested attributes

You can use nested attributes wherever you might use a regular attribute, such as [`searchableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/searchableAttributes/#usage-notes) and [`attributesForFaceting`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesForFaceting/#usage-notes).
Just make sure you use the appropriate dot notation such as `price.country` to refer to them.

There's no limit on the number of nested attributes apart from [the default restrictions on record size](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/index-and-records-size-and-usage-limitations/).
The depth of nesting is also unlimited: you could use something like `price.net.us.ca`.
