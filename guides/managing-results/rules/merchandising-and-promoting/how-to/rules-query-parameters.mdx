The Visual Editor lets you apply filters with [Rules](/guides/managing-results/rules/rules-overview/).
If you want to apply [optional filters](/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/how-to-promote-with-optional-filters/)
or other API parameters, you need to add them in the Manual Editor as JSON.

In this guide, `FACET:VALUE` refers to a [facet-value pair](/glossary/#facet-value-pair), such as, `author:shakespeare`.

## Filters

Filters excludes records that don't match the filter.

| Scenario                      | JSON template                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Select a category**         | `{ "filters":"FACET:VALUE" }`                         |
| **Remove a category**         | `{ "filters":"NOT FACET:VALUE" }`                     |
| **Remove several categories** | `{ "filters":"NOT FACET:VALUE AND NOT FACET:VALUE" }` |

If you have a multi-word `VALUE` (such as William Shakespeare), wrap it in single quotes. For example:

```json json
{
  "filters": "NOT author:'William Shakespeare' AND NOT author:Plato"
}
```

If your `VALUE` contains an apostrophe (such as Tony d'Arbon), escape the apostrophe with double backslashes and wrap the whole string in single quotes. For example:

```json json
{
  "filters": "NOT author:'William Shakespeare' AND NOT author:'Tony d\\'Arbon'"
}
```

## Optional filters

[Optional filters](/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/how-to-promote-with-optional-filters/) don't remove records from the results,
but they promote or demote matching records.
You can fine-tune the behavior of optional filters with [filter scores](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/in-depth/filter-scoring/).

<Note>
  Any attribute you want to use as an optional filter must be [declared as a facet](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/how-to/declaring-attributes-for-faceting/).

### Examples for optional filters

The following examples show different use cases for optional filters, their JSON representation, and the effect on filter scoring.

### Promote a category

**Filter scoring:** +1 for all matching records

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": ["FACET:VALUE"]
}
```

### Promote several categories with equal weight

**Filter scoring:** +1 for all records matching one or more filter

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": ["FACET1:VALUE1", "FACET2:VALUE2"]
}
```

### Promote several categories with different weights per category

**Filter scoring:** +X or +Y, whichever matches and has the highest value

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": ["FACET1:VALUE1<score=X>", "FACET2:VALUE2<score=Y>"]
}
```

### Promote several categories with a combined score

**Filter scoring:** +1 or +2, depending on the number of matching filters

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": ["FACET1:VALUE1", "FACET2:VALUE2"],
  "sumOrFiltersScores": true
}
```

### Promote several categories with combined weighting

**Filter scoring:** +X, +Y, or +X+Y, depending on the matching filters

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": ["FACET1:VALUE1<score=X>", "FACET2:VALUE2<score=Y>"],
  "sumOrFiltersScores": true
}
```

### Demote a category

**Filter scoring:** +1 for all records that don't match the filter

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": ["FACET:-VALUE"]
}
```

### Demote several categories equally

**Filter scoring:** +1 for all records that don't match any of the filters

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": ["FACET1:-VALUE1", "FACET2:-VALUE2"]
}
```

### Optional filters with multiple words

Unlike filters, you don't need to wrap a multi-word `VALUE` with single quotes if it contains spaces.
For example:

```json json
{
  "optionalFilters": [
    ["author:William Shakespeare<score=3>", "author:John Doe<score=2>"]
  ],
  "sumOrFiltersScores": true
}
```
