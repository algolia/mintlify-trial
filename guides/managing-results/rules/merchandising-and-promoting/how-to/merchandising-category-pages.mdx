  Create rules and apply them to merchandise category pages.

With Algolia, you can [merchandise products](/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/) by creating category pages.
For example, you could organize products into categories such as on-sale items, new arrivals, specific brands, product types (like smartphones), or colors.

<Note>
  To use an attribute in a Rule condition with filters, you must first [declare it in `attributesForFaceting`](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/how-to/declaring-attributes-for-faceting/).

## Before you begin

1. [Ensure the attribute you want to use to define categories is searchable](/guides/managing-results/must-do/searchable-attributes/).
1. [Declare the category page identifier as a searchable attributes for faceting](/guides/solutions/ecommerce/browse/tutorials/category-pages/#configure-your-index).

## Merchandise category pages

Merchandise category pages by configuring an identifier, setting a trigger (a condition), and selecting a strategy (a consequence).

### Configure a category page identifier

1. Go to the [**Rules**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/rules/) section in the Algolia dashboard. Select the index to which you want to add a rule.
1. Select **Create your first Rule** and select **Visual Editor**.
1. In the **It all starts here** section, select **Choose category page**.
1. Click **Configure**, then **I'm good, let's go**.
1. Select a [searchable facet](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/how-to/declaring-attributes-for-faceting/) as your **Category page identifier**.
1. Optional: add a **Custom subcategory separator** if you're using [hierarchical categories](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/#hierarchical-facets). For example, for the hierarchical category: `Women / Coat / Raincoat`, enter `/` as the custom separator.
1. **Save** your changes.

### Create a trigger

## Example: promote items on category pages until users start search searching

To promote items on category pages before users start searching, create a rule that's triggered if:

- A user visits the category page
- The query is empty.

   1. Click **Apply**.
1. In the **What do you want to do?** section, select **Pin items**. The **Choose items to pin** pane opens:
   1. Under **Pinned items**, search for the item you wish to pin and enter a number as the **Position** to which you want to pin the item.
   1. Optional: click **Pin another item** and repeat this step.
   1. Click **Apply**.
1. Save your changes.

- Click **Review and Publish** to enable the category page rule.
- Click **Save as Draft** if you don't want the rule to take effect yet.

## Example: display banners on category pages

Category page banners operate similarly to search results [banners](/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/add-banners/), but a filter rather than a search query triggers them.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  This example requires a UI that uses the [`Hits` widget](/api-reference/widgets/hits/js/) from InstantSearch.js version 4.68.1 or later or Reach InstantSearch version 7.8.0 or later.
</Note>

1. Enter the **Image URL** for your banner and click **Apply**.

1. Optional: enter a description that describes what the rule does and enter a period during which the rule is valid.

1. **Apply** your changes.

A banner now displays on every visit to this category page.

### Create the rule in the Manual Editor

1. Go to the [**Rules**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/rules/) section in the Algolia dashboard. Select the index to which you want to add a rule.

1. Select **Create your first Rule** or **New Rule** and select **Manual Editor**.

1. In the **Condition(s)** section:

1. Toggle the **Filters** option on.

1. Toggle the **Query** option off.

1. In the **Attribute name** field, add your category page identifier, for example, `category`.

1. In the **Attribute value** field, add the category for which you want to show a banner, for example, `Smartphone`.

1. In the **Consequence(s)** section:

1. Select **Add consequence > Return Custom Data.**

1. In the input field, enter a JSON object, for example, `{ "banner": "iPhone" }`.

1. Optional: enter a description that describes what the rule does and enter a period during which the rule is valid.

1. **Save** your changes.

Now, every time a user visits the category page, the rule triggers and returns a JSON object as custom data.
You can [display this custom data](/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/add-banners/#retrieve-the-banner-data-in-your-ui) in your UI as a banner.
