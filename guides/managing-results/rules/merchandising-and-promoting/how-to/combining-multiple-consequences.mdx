  How to combine multiple Rules on the same query.
---

When creating a Rule, **it's not uncommon to set more than one consequence**. A good example is when you want to use a search term as a filter or a facet value but not for textual search.

Consider a website where users can search for movies by title, actor, or director. Some actors, like
Clint Eastwood are also directors: people searching for "clint eastwood" might not be looking for the same thing. For example, people looking only for movies directed by Clint Eastwood might search for "clint eastwood director",
hoping to filter out every movie that Clint Eastwood plays in but didn't direct.

In this case, you wouldn't be interested in the word "director for textual search purposes, but as a cue to set a filter. You would therefore want to remove the word "director" from the search query so that the engine doesn't textually look for records matching that word. You can achieve this by **combining several consequences in your Rule**.

## Dataset example

In the following dataset, some movies have Clint Eastwood as an actor, some as a director, and some have both.

```json json
[
  {
    "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",
    "director": "Sergio Leone",
    "actors": ["Clint Eastwood", "Lee Van Cleef", "Elli Wallach"]
  },
  {
    "title": "Dirty Harry",
    "director": "Don Siegel",
    "actors": ["Clint Eastwood", "Andy Robinson", "Harry Guardino"]
  },
  {
    "title": "Million Dollar Baby",
    "director": "Clint Eastwood",
    "actors": ["Clint Eastwood", "Hilary Swank", "Morgan Freeman"]
  },
  {
    "title": "Invictus",
    "director": "Clint Eastwood",
    "actors": ["Morgan Freeman", "Matt Damon", "Tony Kgoroge"]
  }
]
```

If someone searches for
"clint eastwood", they would retrieve all movies by or with Clint Eastwood, even if they were only interested in movies with Clint Eastwood as the director. You could solve this problem with faceting, by setting `director` as an attribute for faceting and providing a refinement list with its own search input on your frontend.

Yet, an even better way of helping your users would be to make your search _smart_ and look only for movies where `director` is equal to "Clint Eastwood" whenever they type "clint eastwood director". To achieve this, you first need to set `director` in your list of attributes for faceting. Then, you can create a new Rule that filters on matching attributes.

You need to create two consequences whenever a user types in "clint eastwood director":

- Filter all results with "director"
- Remove the word "director" from the search

## Using the API

1. Set `director` as [`attributesForFaceting`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesForFaceting/). This happens at indexing time.
1. Set a Rule that:

   - Detects the term "director" in a query whenever it comes after a term that matches the name of a director
   - Applies a filter on facet value `director:'Clint Eastwood'`.

To do this, use the [`saveRule`](/api-reference/api-methods/save-rule/) method.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings { AttributeForDistinct = "director" };

  index.SetSettings(settings);

  // Asynchronous
  await index.SetSettingsAsync(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := index.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	AttributesForFaceting: opt.AttributesForFaceting("director"),
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  index.setSettings(new IndexSettings()
                .setAttributesForFaceting(Collections.singletonList("director")));
  ```

  ```js js
  index
    .setSettings({
      attributesForFaceting: ["director"],
    })
    .then(() => {
      // done
    });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val settings = settings {
      attributesForFaceting {
          +"director"
      }
  }

  index.setSettings(settings)
  ```

  ```php php
  $index->setSettings([
    'attributesForFaceting' => [
      "director"
    ]
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  index.set_settings({"attributesForFaceting": ["director"]})
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  index.set_settings(
    {
      attributesForFaceting: [
        "director"
      ]
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "myIndex" `with` IndexSettings(
      attributesForFaceting = Some(Seq(
        "director")))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  let settings = Settings()
    .set(\.attributesForFaceting, to: ["director"])
  index.setSettings(settings) { result in
    if case .success(let response) = result {
      print("Response: \(response)")
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

However, setting the Rule isn't enough. Even when you set a Rule, the engine still tries to match the terms in the query. If a user searches for
"clint eastwood director",
even if your Rule applies, the engine will look for the word "director" in the records. With the example dataset, this would return no results at all. This is where combining consequences comes in handy.

When this Rule applies, you can add another consequence to remove the word "director" from the query. This way, the engine will only use it for filtering, not search.

  ```csharp csharp
  var rule = new Rule
  {
      ObjectID = "director-rule",
      Conditions = new List<Condition>
      {
          Anchoring = "contains",
          Pattern = "{facet:director} director"
      },
      Consequence = new Consequence
      {
          Params = new ConsequenceParams
          {
              AutomaticFacetFilters = new List<AutomaticFacetFilter>
              {
                  new AutomaticFacetFilter { Facet = "director" }
              },
              Query = new ConsequenceQuery
              {
                  Edits = new List<Edit>
                  {
                      new Edit { Type = EditType.Remove, Delete = "director" }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  };

  index.SaveRule(rule);

  // Asynchronous
  await index.SaveRuleAsync(rule);
  ```

  ```go go

  				search.RuleQueryObjectQuery{
  					Edits: []search.QueryEdit{search.RemoveEdit("director")},
  				},
  			),
  		},
  	},
  }
