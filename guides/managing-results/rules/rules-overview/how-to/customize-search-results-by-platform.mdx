title: Using rules to customize search results by device
description: |-
  Learn how to customize your search results based on whether your user is on a mobile or desktop device.
---

Search needs to be flexible.
Depending on the user's context, results can vary.
For example, because some products are more likely to be bought or viewed from phones than desktops, you may want to promote items based on the user's device.

To do this:

1. Identify your user's device.
1. Assign a `mobile` context when users search from mobile devices. A context is a string passed as a search parameter to InstantSearch or an Algolia API client.
1. Create a contextual rule that acts on the `mobile` context.

<Note>
  To help understand user behavior across devices, pair your device-specific experience with analytics. You can even use the same context string to tag search queries for analytics. These [`analyticsTags`](/guides/search-analytics/guides/segments/) help you group search analytics into different segments.
</Note>

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a movie database company.
Research shows that mobile users, unlike desktop users, tend to see a film in theaters after it has appeared in their search results.
To capitalize on this, you partner with a movie theater chain and decide to promote newly released movies to your mobile users.

The records in your Algolia index include a `release_date` attribute, in [Unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) format, this is useful for identifying newly released movies.

```json json
{
  "title": "Fargo",
  "year": 1996,
  "director": "Joel Coen",
  "release_date": 841795200,
  "rating": 93
}
```

By creating a mobile context and contextual rules, you can promote recent movies to mobile users.

## Identify your user's device

Before assigning a mobile context to searches, write a function that detects what device the app is running on, and return "desktop" or "mobile" depending on what it finds:

```js js
const getPlatform = () => {
  // const isMobile = ...
  // Your logic to determine whether a user is on a mobile or desktop device
  return isMobile ? "mobile" : "desktop";
};
```

## Assign context

You can assign context with InstantSearch or an Algolia API client.

### Assign context with InstantSearch

Set the user's device context at the beginning of their search session by adding it to the `searchParameters` setting of your InstantSearch instance [during initialization](/api-reference/widgets/instantsearch/js/).

<CodeGroup>
  ```html vue
  <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          ruleContexts: getPlatform(),
        };
      },
    };
  </script>
  ```

  ```html angular
  <ais-configure>
    [searchParameters]="{ ruleContexts: [getPlatform()]}"
  </ais-configure>
  ```

  ```js js
  const platformTag = getPlatform();

  instantsearch.widgets.configure({
    ruleContexts: [platformTag],
  });
  ```

  ```jsx react
  import { Configure } from 'react-instantsearch';

  const platformTag = getPlatform()

  <Configure
    ruleContexts=[platformTag]
  />
  ```

  ```kotlin android
  val platform: String = getPlatform()
  val query = query {
      ruleContexts {
          +platform
      }
  }

  val searcher = HitsSearcher(movies, query)
  ```

  ```swift swift
  let platform = getPlatform()

  let searcher = HitsSearcher(appId: "YourAppId", apiKey: "YourAPIKey", indexName: "YourIndexName")

  searcher.request.query.ruleContexts = [platform]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Assign context with an API client

Pass the user's device context as a search parameter whenever you [`search`](/api-reference/api-methods/search/) your index.

```js js
const index = client.initIndex("movies");

const platformTag = getPlatform();

index
  .search("query", {
    ruleContexts: platformTag,
  })
  .then(({ hits }) => {
    console.log(hits);
  });
```

## Create a contextual rule

You can create a mobile contextual rule with an API client or from the Algolia dashboard.

### Create a contextual rule with an API client

Use the [`save-rule`](/api-reference/api-methods/save-rule/) method to create a context-dependent rule.
For example, to promote movies released after January 1, 2020, for mobile users:

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  Rule ruleToSave = new Rule
  {
      ObjectID = "a-rule-id",
      Conditions = new List<Condition> { new Condition { Context = "mobile" } },
      Consequence = new Consequence
      {
          Params = new ConsequenceParams
          {
              AutomaticFacetFilters = new List<AutomaticFacetFilter>
              {
                  new AutomaticFacetFilter { Facet = "release_date >= 1577836800" }
              }
          }
      }
  };

  movies.SaveRule(rule, forwardToReplicas: false);
  ```

  ```go go
  forwardToReplicas := opt.ForwardToReplicas(false)

  rule := search.Rule{
  	ObjectID:   "a-rule-id",
  	Conditions: []search.RuleCondition{{Context: "mobile"}},
  	Consequence: search.RuleConsequence{
  		Params: &search.RuleParams{
  			QueryParams: search.QueryParams{
  				Filters: opt.Filters("release_date >= 1577836800"),
  			},
  		},
  	},
  }

  res, err := movies.SaveRule(rule, forwardToReplicas)
  ```

  ```java java
  Condition condition = new Condition()
      .setContext("smartphone");

  ConsequenceParams params = new ConsequenceParams()
      .setFilters("release_date >= 1577836800");

  Consequence consequence = new Consequence()
      .setParams(params);

  Rule rule =
      new Rule()
          .setObjectID("a-unique-identifier")
          .setConditions(Collections.singletonList(condition))
          .setConsequence(consequence);

  movies.saveRule(rule);

  // Asynchronous
  movies.saveRuleAsync(rule);
  ```

  ```js js
  const rule = {
    objectID: "a-rule-id",
    conditions: [
      {
        context: "mobile",
      },
    ],
    consequence: {
      params: {
        filters: "release_date >= 1577836800",
      },
    },
  };

  movies.saveRule(rule).then(() => {
    // done
  });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val rule = Rule(
      objectID = ObjectID("a-rule-id"),
      conditions = listOf(Condition(
          context = "mobile"
      )),
      consequence = Consequence(
          query = Query(filters = "release_date >= 1577836800")
      ),
  )

  movies.saveRule(rule)
  ```

  ```php php
  $rule = array(
      'objectID' => 'a-rule-id',
      'conditions' => array(array(
          'context' => 'mobile',
      )),
      'consequence' => array(
          'params' => array(
              'filters' => 'release_date >= 1577836800',
          )
      )
  );

  $movies->saveRule($rule);
  ```

  ```python python
  rule = {
      "objectID": "a-rule-id",
      "conditions": [{"context": "mobile"}],
      "consequence": {"params": {"filters": "release_date >= 1577836800"}},
  }

  response = movies.save_rule(rule)
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  rule = {
    objectID: "a-rule-id",
    conditions: [
      {context: "mobile"}
    ],
    consequence: {
      params: {
        filters: "release_date >= 1577836800"
      }
    }
  }

  movies.save_rule(rule)
  ```

  ```scala scala
  val ruleToSave = Rule(
    objectID = "a-rule-id",
    conditions = Some(Seq(Condition(
      context = "mobile", ))),
    consequence = Consequence(
      params = Some(Map("filters" -> "release_date >=  1577836800")), ), )
  client.execute {
    save rule ruleToSave inIndex "movies"
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  let modifiedQuery = Query().set(\.filters, to: "release_date >= 1577836800")

  let rule = Rule(objectID: "a-rule-id")
    .set(\.conditions, to: [Rule.Condition().set(\.context, to: "mobile")])
    .set(\.consequence, to: Rule.Consequence().set(\.query, to: modifiedQuery))

  movies.saveRule(rule) { result in
    if case .success(let response) = result {
      print("Response: \(response)")
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a contextual rule with the dashboard

1. Select the **Search** product icon on your dashboard.

1. Select the **Rules** section from the left sidebar menu in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/rules).

1. Under the heading **Rules**, select the index to which you're adding a rule.

1. Select **Create your first rule** or **New rule**. In the drop-down menu, click the **Manual Editor** option.

1. In the **Condition(s)** section, toggle **Context** on and toggle **Query** off.

1. Enter "mobile" in the context input field.

1. In the **Consequence(s)** sections, click **Add Consequence** and select the **Add Query Parameter** consequence.

1. In the editor, add a filter for the `release_date` attribute.
   For example, to show all movies released since 2020 (`1577836800` is the Unix timestamp for January 1, 2020),
   enter: `{ "filters": "release_date >= 1577836800" }`

1. If you wish, you can add other consequences by clicking **Add consequence**. For example, there may be movies that you want to pin to a specific location or rank at the top,

1. Save your changes.
