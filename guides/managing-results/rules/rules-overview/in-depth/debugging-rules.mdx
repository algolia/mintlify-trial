  How to debug Rules.
---

When you have a large set of Rules, it may be difficult to understand which Rules apply to a given query. Algolia provides tools to help you with this.

The usual [`getRankingInfo`](/api-reference/api-parameters/getRankingInfo/) parameter triggers extra information about Rules:

- **Promoted hits** are labelled with a `"promoted": true` field inside the `_rankingInfo` object. This field is omitted from regular hits.
- The list of **applied Rules** is available inside the `appliedRules` top-level field. This field is omitted when no Rule has been applied (even if `enableRules` is true).

The `params` response field also has search parameters _after_ Rule application, and as such reflects the side-effects of the Rules.

<Note>
  When in doubt, you can always run the same query with `enableRules=false` and compare the results you get with and without Rules.
</Note>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Improving Rules accuracy

Sometimes, creating Rules can lead to lower search accuracy. The following table lists common causes for a lower-than-expected search accuracy when applying Rules.
