  Learn how to set an index's query language through the dashboard and the API.

Most of Algolia's textual matching is language agnostic, meaning **the matching and ranking processes are the same for every language**. If a search textually matches a record, that record is returned. This approach ensures that Algolia works for any language without any extra customization.

However, there are circumstances where knowledge of the query language is vital for accurate search. For example, by identifying your query language, **you can treat plurals and singulars as equivalent**. If your users search for "mice", you most likely don't want to treat the singular "mouse" as a typo.

Two parameters rely on query language:

- [`ignorePlurals`](/api-reference/api-parameters/ignorePlurals/), which treats the singular _and_ plural forms of a word as equivalent (they match even if they're spelled differently).
- [`removeStopWords`](/api-reference/api-parameters/removeStopWords/), which prevents stop words from being processed as a part of the query. English stop words include "the", "a", "an", "and".
  Use [`queryLanguages`](/api-reference/api-parameters/queryLanguages/) to set the languages that these parameters use to determine stop words or plurals.

<Warning>
  You should always set [`queryLanguages`](/api-reference/api-parameters/queryLanguages/) and [`indexLanguages`](/api-reference/api-parameters/indexLanguages/) for your indices. If you don't, the engine uses either the default (all [supported languages](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages/)) or the list of languages specified in [`ignorePlurals`](/api-reference/api-parameters/ignorePlurals/) and [`removeStopWords`](/api-reference/api-parameters/removeStopWords/).
  **This can lead to unexpected search results.**

## Set the index language in the dashboard

1. Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer/browse) and select your Algolia application.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search**.

1. Select your Algolia index:

1. On the **Configuration** tab, click **Language**.

1. Click **Select one or more languages** under the **Query Languages** section, and enter your desired language. You can enter as many languages as you want.
   Likewise, you can also [set `ignorePlurals`](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/how-to/customize-plurals-and-other-declensions/#using-the-dashboard) and [`removeStopWords`](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/how-to/customize-stop-words/) in the Algolia dashboard.

1. Save your changes.

## Set the index language with the API

To set an index's language through the API, use the [`setSettings`](/api-reference/api-methods/set-settings/) method.

In the following example, [`queryLanguages`](/api-reference/api-parameters/queryLanguages/) is set to English and [`ignorePlurals`](/api-reference/api-parameters/ignorePlurals/) is set to `true`. This means "mice" and "mouse" are treated as equal.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings();
  settings.QueryLanguages = new List<string> { "en" };
  settings.IgnorePlurals = true;

  index.SetSettings(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := index.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	QueryLanguages: opt.QueryLanguages("en"),
  	IgnorePlurals:  opt.IgnorePlurals(true),
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  index.setSettings(
    new IndexSettings()
      .setQueryLanguages(Collections.singletonList("en"))
      .setIgnorePlurals(IgnorePlurals.of(true))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  index
    .setSettings({
      queryLanguages: ["en"],
      ignorePlurals: true,
    })
    .then(() => {
      // done
    });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val settings = settings {
      queryLanguages {
          +English
      }
      ignorePlurals = IgnorePlurals.True
  }

  index.setSettings(settings)
  ```

  ```php php
  $index->setSettings([
    'queryLanguages' => ['en'],
    'ignorePlurals' => true
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  index.set_settings({"queryLanguages": ["en"], "ignorePlurals": True})
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  index.set_settings(
    {
      queryLanguages: ["en"],
      ignorePlurals: true
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "myIndex" `with` IndexSettings(
      queryLanguages = Some(QueryLanguages.list(Seq("en"))),
      ignorePlurals = Some(IgnorePlurals.`true`))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  index.setSettings([
    "queryLanguages": ["en"],
    "ignorePlurals": true,
  ])
  ```
