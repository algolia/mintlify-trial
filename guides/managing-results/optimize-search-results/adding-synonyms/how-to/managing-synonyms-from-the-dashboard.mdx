## Add synonyms

To add a new synonym, click **Add Synonyms** and choose the type:

- Synonyms (regular synonyms)
- One-way Synonyms
- Placeholders
- Alternative Corrections.

### Synonyms (regular synonyms)

In the **Synonyms** field, enter your [regular synonyms](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/#regular-synonyms): a comma-separated list of words or expressions that should be considered equivalent.

### One-way synonyms

In the **Search term** field, enter your [one-way synonym](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/#one-way-synonyms): the text used in a query that should be substituted by the comma-separated list of terms in the **Alternatives** field ("top" and "hoodie"/"sweater" in the example).

### Placeholders

In the **Placeholder** field, enter your [placeholder synonym](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/#placeholders): the text, enclosed in angle brackets, used by any query matching one of the **Replacements** (`<street>` for `street` and `st`, in the example).

### Alternative corrections

In the **Search term** field, enter your [alternative corrections synonym](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/#alternative-corrections): the text used in the query that should be substituted by the comma-separated list of alternative words or expressions in the **Corrections** field ("tablet" for "ipad" in the example).

In the **Typo** field, choose the number of typos allowed (1 or 2) when the search term matches one of the corrections.

## Copy synonyms to other indices

You can automatically copy any synonym that you create to other indices. Check the **Copy this expansion to other indices** option and choose your indices if you want this to happen.

## Import synonyms from a file

If you have many synonyms, perhaps sourced by a merchandising team or pulled from an external dictionary, adding them one by one would be time-consuming.
A more straightforward method is to upload an entire file of synonyms at once.
To do this, click the arrow next to **Add Synonyms** and then click **Upload**.

JSON and CSV are the two supported data formats, but CSV is limited to regular synonyms (see below).

### Import synonyms from JSON

The file must contain an array of newline-delimited JSON objects. Each object must include:

- A **unique objectID** value that identifies the synonym record. objectID isn't automatically generated if it's missing.
- A **type** value. [Options are](/api-reference/api-methods/save-synonym/#parameters) `synonym`, `oneWaySynonym`, `altCorrection1`, `altCorrection2`, and `placeholder`.
- All other fields required by [the chosen type](#add-synonyms).

### Import synonyms from CSV

You can only use CSV files to import regular synonyms (`synonym`). The file must contain one set of **comma-separated** synonyms per line.

Algolia accepts CSV files exported by popular spreadsheet apps, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, and LibreOffice Calc.
However, you must ensure that the file uses commas as field separators. On a Mac, this choice of field separator is controlled by the system (in **System Preferences > Language & Region > Advanced > Number separators: Grouping**).

## Export synonyms to a file

To back up or take a snapshot of your synonyms, click the arrow next to **Add Synonyms** and click **Export as JSON** or **Export as CSV**.
CSV export is limited to regular synonyms.

## Delete one synonym

To delete a specific synonym, click the **Delete synonym** (trash can icon).

## Delete all synonyms

To remove all synonyms from an index, click the arrow next to **Add Synonyms** and then click **Delete All**.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Warning>
  You can't undo this operation.
</Warning>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Check **Delete all these expansions on other indices** to propagate the deletion to all chosen indices.

## Edit synonyms

Click **Edit synonyms** (pencil icon).
