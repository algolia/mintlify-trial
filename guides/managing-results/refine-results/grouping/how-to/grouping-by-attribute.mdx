title: How to group results
description: |-
  Grouping repeated data with Algolia's Distinct feature, by merging records into distinct groups, aggregating results, and flattening hierarchies.
---

Algolia works differently than relational databases. When fetching data from a database, you can select what you need, perform complex operations to aggregate data from different tables together, and get data in a format that's already close to how you want to display it on your frontend. With Algolia, every time you have a match within one or more of your records, **the engine returns the full records ranked by relevance**.

Sometimes your data contains records that are parts of a larger record. This can happen with a blog article that is broken up into one paragraph per record. It can also happen when several records share a common source, as in a hierarchy or one-to-many relationship. A good example of this is with job openings, where companies offer multiple job offers.

As you'll see, the solution is to **flatten records and repeat some data**. In the job offer example, you only want to show the most relevant 1 or 3 offers per company, leaving room for other companies.

For more information about breaking up large texts, see [Indexing long documents](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/indexing-long-documents/)

## Dataset example: job offer

### Before

Using a "traditional" approach to structuring records, the dataset could look like this:

```json json
[
  {
    "company": "Twilio",
    "job_openings": [
      "Staff Software Engineer - Cloud Platform",
      "Lead Frontend Engineer",
      "Senior Data Engineer",
      "Senior Software Engineer, Developer Experience"
    ]
  },
  {
    "company": "Algolia",
    "job_openings": [
      "Full-Stack Software Engineer",
      "Frontend Engineer",
      "Open Source Software Engineer (JavaScript)",
      "Senior Software Engineer - Core API",
      "Senior Systems Engineer - SRE"
    ]
  }
]
```

The problem with this structure is that whenever you have a match for any opening, the engine returns the full record for the company. If you want to show the best match per company, this data structure doesn't work.

If you want to show a limited number of job openings per company, the right approach would be to **split content into smaller records, by job opening, and repeat company data**.

### After

With the strategy of splitting records per company, you would have a single record per job opening, and repeat the company in each. Here's what it might look like:

```json json
[
  {
    "company": "Twilio",
    "job_opening": "Staff Software Engineer - Cloud Platform"
  },
  {
    "company": "Twilio",
    "job_opening": "Lead Frontend Engineer"
  },
  {
    "company": "Twilio",
    "job_opening": "Senior Data Engineer"
  },
  {
    "company": "Twilio",
    "job_opening": "Senior Software Engineer, Developer Experience"
  },
  {
    "company": "Algolia",
    "job_opening": "Full-Stack Software Engineer"
  },
  {
    "company": "Algolia",
    "job_opening": "Frontend Engineer"
  },
  {
    "company": "Algolia",
    "job_opening": "Open Source Software Engineer (JavaScript)"
  },
  {
    "company": "Algolia",
    "job_opening": "Senior Software Engineer - Core API"
  },
  {
    "company": "Algolia",
    "job_opening": "Senior Systems Engineer - SRE"
  }
]
```

This approach has many benefits. First, job openings are no longer intertwined, which allows for more granular search. Whenever someone searches for a position, for example, "engineer", they no longer retrieve records representing a company with the full job openings list. Instead, **they get single, best matching job positions, that can be individually ranked with custom ranking attributes**.

Besides, you can handle the duplicate data with Algolia's [distinct feature](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/grouping/). Enabling this would let you, for example, only retrieve the best matching position per `company`.

## Configuring `attributeForDistinct` and enabling distinct

### Using the API

To use [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) you first need to set `company` as [`attributeForDistinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributeForDistinct/) during indexing time. Only then can you set [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) to `true` to deduplicate your results.
Note that setting [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) at indexing time is optional. If you want to, you can set it at query time instead.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings { AttributeForDistinct = "company", Distinct = true };

  index.SetSettings(settings);

  // Asynchronous
  await index.SetSettingsAsync(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := index.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	AttributeForDistinct: opt.AttributeForDistinct("company"),
  	Distinct:             opt.Distinct(true),
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  index.setSettings(
    new IndexSettings()
      .setAttributeForDistinct("company")
      .setDistinct(Distinct.of(true))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  index
    .setSettings({
      attributeForDistinct: "company",
      distinct: true,
    })
    .then(() => {
      // done
    });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val settings = settings {
      attributeForDistinct = Attribute("company")
      distinct = true
  }

  index.setSettings(settings)
  ```

  ```php php
  $index->setSettings([
    'attributeForDistinct' => 'company',
    'distinct' => true
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  index.set_settings({"attributeForDistinct": "company", "distinct": True})
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  index.set_settings(
    {
      attributeForDistinct: "company",
      distinct: true
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "myIndex" `with` IndexSettings(
      attributeForDistinct = Some("company"),
      distinct = Some(true))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  index.setSettings([
    "attributeForDistinct": "company",
    "distinct": true,
  ])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once [`attributeForDistinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributeForDistinct/) is set, you can enable [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) by setting it to `true`. Note that you can set [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) to `true` or `1` interchangeably. If you wanted to show the three best positions for one company, you could set [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct/) to `3`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  index.Search(new Query<JObject>("query") { Distinct = true });
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := index.Search(
  	"query",
  	opt.Distinct(true),
  )
  ```

  ```java java
  index.search(
    new Query("query").setDistinct(Distinct.of(true))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  index
    .search("query", {
      distinct: true,
    })
    .then(({ hits }) => {
      console.log(hits);
    });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val query = query("query") {
      distinct = Distinct(1)
  }

  index.search(query)
  ```

  ```php php
  $results = $index->search('query', [
    'distinct' => true
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  results = index.search("query", {"distinct": True})
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  results = index.search(
    "query",
    {
      distinct: true
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    search into "myIndex" query Query(
      query = Some("query"),
      distinct = Some(true))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  let query = Query(query: "query")
  query.distinct = true

  index.search(
    query,
    completionHandler: { (res, error) in
      print(res)
    })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Using the dashboard

You can also set your attribute for distinct and enable distinct in your Algolia dashboard.

1. Go to your dashboard and select your index.
1. Click the **Configuration** tab, then click **Deduplication and Grouping**.
1. Set **Distinct** to **true**
1. Select attribute "company" in the **Attribute for Distinct** drop-down menu.
1. Save your changes.
