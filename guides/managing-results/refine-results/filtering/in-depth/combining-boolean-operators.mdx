  How to combine filters and facetFilters using boolean operators.
---

Algolia supports the following operators, which must be in capital letters:

- **`OR`**: must match any of the combined conditions
- **`AND`**: must match all the combined conditions
- **`NOT`**: negates a filter

## Use of parentheses

Use parentheses `(` and `)` to combine several OR conditions.
These rules apply:

- Don't group ANDs within ORs. For example, `A OR (B AND C) OR (D AND E)` isn't allowed
- Top-level AND conditions don't require parentheses. For example, `(A AND (B OR C))` and `(A AND B)` aren't allowed.
- Don't use parentheses to negate a group of expressions. For example, `NOT (filter1 OR filter2)` isn't allowed.

### Examples of correct usage

- `A AND (B OR C)`
- `(A OR B) AND C`
- `A AND (B OR C) AND (D OR E)`
- `A AND B AND (C OR D) AND (E OR F)`
- `(A OR B) AND (C OR D) AND E`

#### Example scenarios

- Find books _not_ written by a specific author: `(category:Book OR category:Ebook) AND NOT author:"JK Rowling"`
- Filter products by price range and category: `price:10 TO 50 AND (category:Electronics OR category:Accessories)`
- Complex filter with several conditions: `inStock:true AND (category:Phones OR category:Tablets) AND (brand:Apple OR brand:Samsung) AND price>500`

## Don't mix filter types in OR conditions

You can't compare different filter types (string, numeric, tags) with an `OR`.
For example, `num=3 OR tag1 OR facet:value` isn't allowed.

## Apps and user actions change filter expressions

If a user or app selects a filter, Algolia omits the filters that don't apply from the expression.

For example, if the original filter expression is `((category:Electronics OR category:Home) AND NOT brand:LG) AND NOT price:100 TO 500` and the user selects the Electronics category, the expression simplifies to `(category:Electronics AND NOT brand:LG) AND NOT price:100 TO 500`.
