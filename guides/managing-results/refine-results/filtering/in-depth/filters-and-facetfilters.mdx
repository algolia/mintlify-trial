  Learn about the relationship between filters and facetFilters.
---

For most uses, the `filters` parameter is the best choice for filtering.
However, `numericFilters` and `facetFilters` also offer comparable capabilities and can be used to suit different filtering needs.

## Differences between filtering parameters

Whatever filtering parameter you use, the aim is to filter records based on their attributes.
To exclude results, use the NOT [operator](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/in-depth/combining-boolean-operators/).
However, there are some differences:

### `filters`

|            | Notes                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter  | [`filters`](/api-reference/api-parameters/filters/)                        |
| Syntax     | String                                                                     |
| Best for   | Filtering with a mix of string and numeric filters                         |
| Key points | A familiar SQL syntax. You can use boolean logical operators: AND, OR, NOT |

#### Examples

Find all books written by Stephen King:

```js js
index.search("", {
  filters: 'author:"Stephen King"',
});
```

Exclude all non-fiction books (based on their [tag](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/how-to/filter-by-attributes/#filter-by-tags)):

```js js
index.search("", {
  filters: "NOT _tags:non-fiction",
});
```

### `numericFilters`

|            | Notes                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter  | [`numericFilters`](/api-reference/api-parameters/numericFilters/) |
| Syntax     | String                                                            |
| Best for   | Filtering dates and numeric values                                |
| Key points | Like `filters` but limited to numeric data                        |

#### Example

Find all books that cost more than $20:

```js js
index.search("", {
  numericFilters: "price>20",
});
```

### `facetFilters`

|            | Notes                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter  | [`facetFilters`](/api-reference/api-parameters/facetFilters/) |
| Syntax     | String or string array                                        |
| Best for   | Filtering with a mix of strings and complex boolean logic     |
| Key points | Can't be used for numeric filtering                           |

#### Examples

Find books written by Stephen King _or_ belonging to the horror genre, _and_ also published by Penguin.

```js js
index.search("", {
  facetFilters: [["author:Stephen King", "genre:Horror"], "publisher:Penguin"],
});
```

Exclude eBooks from the results:

```js js
index.search("", {
  facetFilters: "category:-Ebook",
});
```

## Combining `filters` and `facetFilters`

You can combine filter and facet filters in the same search query. For example:

```js js
index.search("", {
  filters: '(author:"Stephen King" OR genre:"Horror")',
  facetFilters: ["publisher:Penguin"],
});
```

In this case, the results of this are the same as the preceding [example for `facetFilters`](#examples) but more generally may prove to be more flexible.
For example, you can use `filters` programmatically to create a reduced set of records based on a user's profile, and then apply `facetFilters` to reflect the facets that users have chosen.

## Limits and performance

Since each filter adds complexity to queries, there's a limit on the total number of combined filters you can use of 1,000.
