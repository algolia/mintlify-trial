title: Delete a replica index
description: |-
  Learn how to delete replica indices in the dashboard and with the API.
---

In the Algolia dashboard, you can delete replica indices like regular indices.
For more information, see [Delete indices in the Algolia dashboard](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/delete-indices/#delete-indices-in-the-algolia-dashboard).

Using the API, you can delete a replica index in two steps:

1. Unlink the replica index from its primary.
   This turns the replica into a regular index.
1. Delete the (former) replica index.

## Unlink replica indices with the API

To unlink a replica index from its primary index,
remove it from the [`replicas`](/api-reference/api-parameters/replicas/) setting of the primary index,
using the [`setSettings`](/api-reference/api-methods/set-settings/) method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings { Replicas = new List<string> { } };

  // Set Settings--Synchronous
  primary_index.SetSettings(settings);

  // Set Settings--Asynchronous
  await primary_index.SetSettingsAsync(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res1, err := primaryIndex.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	Replicas: opt.Replicas(),
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  primary_index.setSettings(
    new IndexSettings().setReplicas(Arrays.asList(""))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  primaryIndex.setSettings({
    replicas: [],
  });
  ```

  ```php php
  $primary_index->setSettings([
    'replicas' => []
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  primary_index.set_settings({"replicas": []})
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  primary_index.set_settings(
    {
      replicas: []
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "primary_index" `with` IndexSettings(
      replicas = Some(Seq("")))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  primary_index.setSettings([
    "replicas": []
  ])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  If want to keep other replicas,
  don't remove them from the `replicas` setting.
  If you set `replicas` to an empty string or list,
  **all** replicas will be unlinked.
</Warning>

Now, you can [delete your replica index](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/delete-indices/#delete-indices-with-the-api).
