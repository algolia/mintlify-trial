  How to sort your records by date.
---

By design, Algolia provides one [ranking strategy](/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/#algolias-ranking-strategy) per [index](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/prepare-data-in-depth/#algolia-index): when you want to provide different rankings for the same data, **you need to use different indices for each ranking**.
These indices are called [replicas](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/replicas/).

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  To set up sorting by attribute, you first need to understand how [replica indices](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/replicas/) work.
</Note>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

To sort by attribute, create a replica index and then change the ranking formula of the replica.
You can do this from Algolia's dashboard or through the API.

For chronological sorting, consider [how Algolia handles dates](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/what-is-in-a-record/#dates).
For example, you have a blog and want to create a replica to sort search results from the most recent to the oldest post.
Because Algolia doesn't interpret dates as ISO 8601 strings (such as "2008-09-15T15:53:00"),
**you must convert your dates into Unix timestamps** (numeric values such as 1221486780) before sorting them.

## Convert dates into Unix timestamps: an example

### Before

Say you have an index called `articles`:

```json json
[
  {
    "post_title": "Let's start the adventure",
    "post_date": "2012-07-01",
    "author_name": "Nicolas Dessaigne",
    "author_image_url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/785489bc2ac2e08ae66648a8936c1101?s=40&d=mm&r=g",
    "permalink": "https://blog.algolia.com/lets-start-the-adventure/",
    "excerpt": "Welcome to The Algolia Blog! It's always difficult to write the first post of a blog! What should I talk about? The company, the founders, the business, the culture? And all that knowing that virtually nobody will read except diggers in a few years (hopefully)!\nLet's concentrate instead on what we'll be blogging about. Company news obviously, but not only.

  },
  {
    "post_title": "Great discussions at LeWeb'12 London",
    "post_date": "2012-07-03",
    "author_name": "Nicolas Dessaigne",
    "author_image_url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/785489bc2ac2e08ae66648a8936c1101?s=40&d=mm&r=g",
    "permalink": "https://blog.algolia.com/great-discussions-at-leweb12-london/",
    "image": "https://blog.algolia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/latency-360x200.png",
    "excerpt": "... take long for us to decide it was the way to go, since the perception of speed is so natural that the benefit far outweighs the longer integration code. We'll now work on simplifying it!\nWe'll soon do a post about this demo. In the meantime, stay tuned!\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;"
  }
]
```

### After

You want to create a replica that sorts your data by date. The problem is that the `post_date` attribute has dates formatted as strings, which Algolia can't process for sorting. Before creating a replica, you must transform these dates into [Unix timestamps](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

You don't have to remove or change `post_date`. Add a `post_date_timestamp` attribute with the proper format instead.

```json json
[
  {
    "post_title": "Let's start the adventure",
    "post_date": "2012-07-01",
    "post_date_timestamp": 1341100800,
    "author_name": "Nicolas Dessaigne",
    "author_image_url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/785489bc2ac2e08ae66648a8936c1101?s=40&d=mm&r=g",
    "permalink": "https://blog.algolia.com/lets-start-the-adventure/",
    "excerpt": "Welcome to The Algolia Blog! It's always difficult to write the first post of a blog! What should I talk about? The company, the founders, the business, the culture?

  {

    "post_date": "2012-07-03",
    "post_date_timestamp": 1341273600,

```

## Create a replica

Now, create a replica of your `articles` index.
The recommendation is to name your replica indices with a prefix or suffix describing its sorting strategy (for example, `articles_date_desc`).

First, [create a standard or virtual replica](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/how-to/creating-replicas/) (`articles_date_desc`) from the primary index.
The primary index is likely sorted by relevance but you want to change that for `articles_date_desc`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings
  {
      Replicas = new List<string>
      {
          "articles_date_desc" // Create a standard replica
          // "virtual(articles_date_desc)" // Create a virtual replica
      }
  };

  index.SetSettings(settings);

  // Asynchronous
  await index.SetSettingsAsync(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := index.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	Replicas: opt.Replicas("articles_date_desc"), // Create a standard replica
  	// Replicas: opt.Replicas("virtual(articles_date_desc)"), // Create a virtual replica
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  index.setSettings(
          new IndexSettings().setReplicas(Collections.singletonList(
                  "articles_date_desc" // Create a standard replica
                  // "virtual(articles_date_desc)" // Create a virtual replica
          ))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  index
    .setSettings({
      replicas: [
        "articles_date_desc", // Create a standard replica
        // 'virtual(articles_date_desc)' // Create a virtual replica
      ],
    })
    .then(() => {
      // done
    });
  ```

  ```php php
  $index->setSettings([
    'replicas' => [
      'articles_date_desc' // Create a standard replica
      // 'virtual(articles_date_desc)' // Create a virtual replica
    ]
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  index.set_settings(
      {
          "replicas": [
              "articles_date_desc"  # Create a standard replica
              # 'virtual(articles_date_desc)' # Create a virtual replica
          ]
      }
  )
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  index.set_settings(
    {
      replicas: [
        # Create a standard replica
        "articles_date_desc"
        # 'virtual(articles_date_desc)' # Create a virtual replica
      ]
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "products" `with` IndexSettings(
      replicas = Some(Seq(
        "articles_date_desc" // Create a standard replica
      // "virtual(articles_date_desc)" // Create a virtual replica
      )))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  index.setSettings([
    "replicas": [
      "articles_date_desc"  // Create a standard replica
      // "virtual(articles_date_desc)" // Create a virtual replica
    ]
  ])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then, use the `post_date_timestamp` attribute to sort the `articles_date_desc` virtual index by date in descending order:

### Sort a standard replica

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings
  {
      Ranking = new List<string> { "desc(post_date_timestamp)" }
  };

  articles_date_desc.SetSettings(settings);

  // Asynchronous
  await articles_date_desc.SetSettingsAsync(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := articles_date_desc.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	Ranking: opt.Ranking(
  		"desc(post_date_timestamp)",
  	),
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  articles_date_desc.setSettings(
        new IndexSettings().setRanking(Arrays.asList(
                "desc(post_date_timestamp)"
                ))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  articles_date_desc
    .setSettings({
      ranking: ["desc(post_date_timestamp)"],
    })
    .then(() => {
      // done
    });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val settings = settings {
      ranking {
          +Desc("post_date_timestamp")
      }
  }

  index.setSettings(settings)
  ```

  ```php php
  $articles_date_desc->setSettings([
    'ranking' => [
      'desc(post_date_timestamp)',
    ]
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  articles_date_desc.set_settings(
      {
          "ranking": [

          ]
      }
  )
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  articles_date_desc.set_settings(
    {
      ranking: [
        "desc(post_date_timestamp)"
      ]
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "articles_date_desc" `with` IndexSettings(
      ranking = Some(Seq(
        Ranking.desc("post_date_timestamp"))))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
  articles_date_desc.setSettings([
    "ranking": [
      "desc(post_date_timestamp)"
    ]
  ])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Sort a virtual replica

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp csharp
  IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings
  {
      CustomRanking = new List<string> { "desc(post_date_timestamp)" }
  };

  articles_date_desc.SetSettings(settings);

  // Asynchronous
  await articles_date_desc.SetSettingsAsync(settings);
  ```

  ```go go
  res, err := articles_date_desc.SetSettings(search.Settings{
  	CustomRanking: opt.CustomRanking(
  		"desc(post_date_timestamp)",
  	),
  })
  ```

  ```java java
  articles_date_desc.setSettings(
        new IndexSettings().setCustomRanking(Arrays.asList(
                "desc(post_date_timestamp)"
                ))
  );
  ```

  ```js js
  articles_date_desc
    .setSettings({
      customRanking: ["desc(post_date_timestamp)"],
    })
    .then(() => {
      // done
    });
  ```

  ```kotlin kotlin
  val settings = settings {
      customRanking {
          +Desc("post_date_timestamp")
      }
  }

  index.setSettings(settings)
  ```

  ```php php
  $articles_date_desc->setSettings([
    'customRanking' => [
      'desc(post_date_timestamp)',
    ]
  ]);
  ```

  ```python python
  articles_date_desc.set_settings(
      {
          "customRanking": [
              "desc(post_date_timestamp)",
          ]
      }
  )
  ```

  ```ruby ruby
  articles_date_desc.set_settings(
    {
      customRanking: [
        "desc(post_date_timestamp)"
      ]
    }
  )
  ```

  ```scala scala
  client.execute {
    setSettings of "articles_date_desc" `with` IndexSettings(
      customRanking = Some(Seq(
        CustomRanking.desc("post_date_timestamp"))))
  }
  ```

  ```swift swift
