Often, conversions start with a search query and finish _outside_ the search results page.
For example, consider this sequence of user events on an ecommerce website:

1. User searches for a product or browses a category page.
1. User clicks one or more products and opens their product detail pages.
1. After visiting one or more product detail pages, user adds the product they like the most to the shopping cart.

You can track this as a conversion event related to an Algolia query.

Connect the conversion event to the search query with a `queryID` parameter,
which uniquely identifies an Algolia search query.
To keep track of query IDs across pages,
it's best to include them as URL parameters.

To track conversions unrelated to a previous search,
you can send a conversion event without a `queryID`.

## Get the `queryID` for every search

To generate a `queryID` with every search,
set the `clickAnalytics` parameter to `true`.

If you're using an API client, run:

import EnableClickAnalytics from '/snippets/insights/enable-click-analytics.mdx';

If you're using InstantSearch or Autocomplete, set the `insights` option to `true`:

</CardGroup>

## Use InstantSearch or Autocomplete to track the `queryID` for conversion events

InstantSearch and Autocomplete keep track of the `queryID` when users click search results.
When sending conversion events, [`search-insights`](/api-reference/insights-api/) automatically includes the `queryID` in the event payload if you
pass `inferQueryID: true` for each call.

## Track the `queryID` as a URL parameter

You can add the `queryID` as a URL parameter to the URL of the product detail page.
For example, on your InstantSearch search results page:

import ReadingQueryid from '/snippets/insights/reading-queryid.mdx';

To read the `queryID` from the URL, you can use the [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/searchParams):

```js Javascript
const url = new URL(window.location.href)
const searchParams = url.searchParams

const queryID = searchParams.get('queryID')
```

Tracking the `queryID` with URL parameters is the best way to ensure that conversion events match the correct search.
For example, users might open several product detail pages from your category page or search results.
This pattern is sometimes called [page parking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/multi-tab-page-parking/).

When you use URL parameters to keep track of the query ID,
follow SEO best practices.
For more information, read the [URL parameter handling](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/technical-seo/url-parameter-handling/) article in Search Engine Journal.

## Track the `queryID` in cookies or local storage

You could track the `queryID` in a `cookie`, `localStorage`, or `sessionStorage`.

For example, to store the latest `queryID` in the browser's local storage:

```js JavaScript
// Write `queryID` to local storage
localStorage.setItem("queryID", queryID);

// Read `queryID` from local storage
let queryID = localStorage.getItem("queryID");
```

This example only stores one `queryID` from the last search query that the user performed.
If the user has multiple product detail pages open from previous searches, the conversion event won't have the correct `queryID`.

Storing the `queryID` in a cookie or the browser's local storage may require your users' consent.

## Send the conversion event

To send the conversion event, use the `convertedObjectIDsAfterSearch` method.
