When you build your search and browse interface, **you should implement sending events at the same time.**
This lets you [validate your user events](/guides/send-events/guides/validate/) before going live and collect enough events to make an impact sooner.

When planning which events to send, consider all interaction points your users have with your site:

- Category pages
- Search results pages
- Autocomplete menu
- Emails, newsletters, push notifications, and other pages

## Must-have events for ecommerce

Every ecommerce search and browse implementation should send click events
when users click products after performing a search.
They should also include conversion events when users add products to the shopping cart.
