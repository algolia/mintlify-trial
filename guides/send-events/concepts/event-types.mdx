description: Learn about the different events you can collect with the Algolia Insights API and the features they unlock.
---

The Algolia Insights API accepts three types of events: click, conversion, and view events.
By sending events, you can enable one or more Algolia features.

To get started with your implementation,
see [Get started with click and conversion events](/guides/send-events/get-started/).

## Events by features

The following table lists events and where they're used.

import Events from '/snippets/insights/events.mdx';

<Events />

To learn more about the properties of each event,
see the [Insights API reference](/api-reference/insights-api/).

## Minimum number of events

In general, the features that require events work better with more events.
Some features need a minimum number of events to be active.

### Events requirements for NeuralSearch

- **Minimum** 1,000 click **OR** 100 conversion events within 30 days.

NeuralSearch uses these events:

import Neuralsearch from '/snippets/insights/neuralsearch-events.mdx';

<Neuralsearch />

### Events requirements for Recommend—Frequently Bought Together

- **Minimum** 1,000 conversion events with 2 or more products within 30 days
- **Maximum** 3,000,000 conversion events within 30 days

If there aren't enough events within 30 days, the collection period extends to 90 days.

Frequently Bought Together uses these events:

import Frequentlyboughttogether from '/snippets/insights/frequentlyboughttogether-events.mdx';

<Frequentlyboughttogether />

### Events requirements for Recommend—Related Products

- **Minimum** 10,000 events within 30 days
- **Maximum** 3,000,000 events within 30 days

If there aren't enough events within 30 days, the collection period extends to 90 days.

Related Products uses these events:

import Relatedproducts from '/snippets/insights/relatedproducts-events.mdx';

<Relatedproducts />

### Events requirements for Recommend—Related Content

- **Minimum** 10 events on items with content-based attributes within 30 days
- **Maximum** 1,500,000 events within 30 days

If there aren't enough events within 30 days, the collection period extends to 90 days.

Related Content uses the same events as the Related Products model.

### Events requirements for Recommend—Trending Items and Trending Facet Values

- **Minimum** 500 conversion events within 30 days
- **Maximum** 3,000,000 conversion events.

Trending Items and Trending Facet Values use these events:

import Trending from '/snippets/insights/trending-events.mdx';

<Trending />

### Events requirements for Dynamic Re-Ranking

- **Minimum** 20 click events **OR** 2 conversion events within 30 days

Records with fewer events won't be re-ranked.

Dynamic Re-Ranking uses these events:

import Drr from '/snippets/insights/drr-events.mdx';

<Drr />

To prevent a manipulation of your ranking,
Dynamic Re-Ranking only considers **1 event per user (`userToken`) per search query per record (`objectID`).**

### Events requirements for Query Categorization

Query Categorization needs a minimum number of events to train the model for predicting categories.
It always uses events from the last 90 days.

Query Categorization uses these events:

import Qcat from '/snippets/insights/qcat-events.mdx';

<Qcat />

## Events on category pages

You can build category pages with Algolia by sending a request with an empty search query and an applied filter.

Because category pages are just a different form of search requests,
you'll use the same events for category pages and search results.

## Events related and unrelated to Algolia requests

Some events come in two variants: with and without a query ID.
Events with a query ID have `AfterSearch` in their name.

Most Algolia features use events with query IDs, for example, to calculate the conversion rate of your search.

### What is the query ID?

The `queryID` is a random sequence of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies a search request.
Algolia uses the query ID to connect a search or [browse](#events-on-category-pages) request to a click or conversion event.
Use the [events debugger](/guides/send-events/guides/validate/#debugger) to check which search API request corresponds to which event.
Algolia generates the query ID and includes it in the API response if you set `clickAnalytics` to `true` when making the search request.

Since conversions often occur outside Algolia-driven experiences—for example, from the shopping cart,
you need to [keep track of the query ID](/guides/send-events/guides/queryid/) on your site.

### Events related to Algolia requests

To track events after a previous Algolia search or browse request,
set the `clickAnalytics` parameter to `true` and
use the `clickedObjectIDsAfterSearch` or `convertedObjectIDsAfterSearch` methods.

Examples include:

- A user searches and clicks a search result to visit a detail page.
  You can track this by sending a `clickedObjectIDsAfterSearch` event.
- A user converts on a category page you built with Algolia.
  You can track this by sending a `convertedObjectIDsAfterSearch` event.

<Note>Click and conversion events with a `queryID` are **time-sensitive.** They must occur within one hour of the corresponding search request.</Note>

### Events unrelated to Algolia requests

To track events that are unrelated to a previous Algolia search or browse request,
use the `clickedObjectIDs` and `convertedObjectIDs` methods.

Examples include:

- You're not using Algolia to build your category pages.
  Use `clickedObjectIDs` to track clicks and `convertedObjectIDs` to track conversions.

- You're sending [emails with recommendations](https://www.algolia.com/developers/code-exchange/personalized-email-recommendations/).
  When users click a recommendation and buy an item, track the conversion with `convertedObjectIDs`.

- In a [buy-online, pick-up in-store](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/building-a-store-locator-in-react-using-algolia-mapbox-and-twilio-part-1/) scenario,
  the conversion finishes hours or days after the initial search or browse request.
  Use `convertedObjectIDs` to track the conversion.
