## Keep track of query IDs

Conversion events are often triggered on pages that aren't covered by InstantSearch,
such as your product details pages, or the checkout page.

import InstantSearchTrackQueryid from '/snippets/insights/instantsearch-track-queryid.mdx';

## Track add-to-cart events

### Using InstantSearch widgets

When your users add an item to their cart, send a special `conversion` event with the `addToCart` subtype.

import AddToCart from '/snippets/insights/add-to-cart.mdx';

import EventPrices from '/snippets/insights/event-prices.mdx';

### On pages without InstantSearch widgets

Add the following code to all components and pages where users can add products to their shopping cart.

For add-to-cart events associated with a search:

```js JavaScript
window.aa("addedToCartObjectIDsAfterSearch", {
  eventName: "Product Added To Cart",
  index: "YourIndexName",
  queryID: "queryID-1",
  objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
  objectData: [
    {
      price: 19.99,
      discount: 3.99,
      quantity: 3,
    },
  ],
  currency: "USD",
});
```

The `windows.aa` object is the API client for the Insights API and is globally available
if you enabled automatic events collection.
The `queryID` parameter is used by Algolia to relate the event to a prior search or browse event.

For add-to-cart events not related to a search query, for example, after a user clicks on a
'Recommended for you' or 'Buy again' carousel on the home page:

```js JavaScript
window.aa("addedToCartObjectIDs", {
  eventName: "Recommended Product Added To Cart",
  index: "YourIndexName",
  objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
  objectData: [
    {
      price: 68.5,
      quantity: 2,
    },
  ],
  currency: "USD",
});
```

## Track purchase events

### Using InstantSearch widgets

When your users purchase an item, send a special `conversion` event with the `purchase` subtype.

import PurchaseEvent from '/snippets/insights/purchase-event.mdx';

import Prices from '/snippets/insights/event-prices.mdx';

### On pages without InstantSearch widgets

Add the following code to your checkout flow:

```js JavaScript
window.aa("purchasedObjectIDsAfterSearch", {
  userToken: "anonymous-123456", // required for Node.js
  authenticatedUserToken: "user-123456",
  eventName: "your_event_name",
  index: "your_index_name",
  objectIDs: ["objectID-1", "objectID-2"],
  objectData: [
    {
      queryID: "queryID-1",
      price: 19.99,
      discount: 3.99,
      quantity: 3,
    },
    {
      queryID: "queryID-2",
      price: 59.99,
      quantity: 2,
    },
  ],
  currency: "USD",
});
```

## Track other conversion events

You can track other conversions in addition to add-to-cart and purchase events.

import InstantSearchTrackConversionEvents from '/snippets/insights/instantsearch-track-conversion-events.mdx';

### On pages without InstantSearch widgets

This is an example of a conversion that may occur on a page without InstantSearch:

```js JavaScript
// A user added a product to their wishlist from the homepage
window.aa("convertedObjectIDs", {
  eventName: "Product Added To Wishlist",
  index: "YourIndexName",
  objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
});
```

## Track click events

### Override default click events

The `hits` and `infiniteHits` widgets expose a `sendEvent` function.
Use it to send `click` events when users interact with your search results.

import ClickEvent1 from '/snippets/insights/click-event-1.mdx';

You can set more events on specific parts of your template.
In the following example, when clicking on the **Add to favorites** button, two events are sent to the Insights API:

- A `click` event with the `eventName` "Product Added to Favorites"
- A `click` event with the `eventName` "Product Clicked" (through event propagation)

import ClickEvent2 from '/snippets/insights/click-event-2.mdx';

To only send the most specific event per clicked element, you can use [`Event.stopPropagation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) in your event handler.

import ClickEvent3 from '/snippets/insights/click-event-3.mdx';

When InstantSearch captures a custom `click` event that you defined, it doesn't send the default `click` event.
In the following example, when clicking the **Add to favorites** button, only the "Product Added to Favorites" event is sent.

import ClickEvent4 from '/snippets/insights/click-event-4.mdx';

### Track additional click events

For Algolia Recommend and Personalization, capture additional click events
when users select individual products:

- On your home page
- From product recommendations

To send click events with the Insights client, add the following code
whenever a user clicks on a product---for example,
on your homepage.

```js JavaScript
window.aa("clickedObjectIDs", {
  index: "YourIndexName",
  eventName: "Product Clicked",
  objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
});
```

import InstantsearchPersonalization from '/snippets/insights/instantsearch-personalization.mdx';

import Examples from '/snippets/insights/examples.mdx';
