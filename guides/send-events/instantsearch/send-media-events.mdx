## Keep track of query IDs

Conversion events are often triggered on pages that aren't covered by InstantSearch,
such as your content details pages.

import TrackQueryid from '/snippets/insights/instantsearch-track-queryid.mdx';

< TrackQueryid />

## Track conversion events

import TrackConversionEvents from '/snippets/insights/instantsearch-track-conversion-events.mdx';

<TrackConversionEvents />

### On pages without InstantSearch widgets

import ConversionEvents from '/snippets/insights/track-conversion-events.mdx';

<ConversionEvents />

## Track click events

### Override default click events

The `hits` and `infiniteHits` widgets expose a `sendEvent` function.
Use it to send `click` events when users interact with your search results.

import MediaClickEvent1 from '/snippets/insights/media-click-event-1.mdx';

< MediaClickEvent1 />

You can set more events on specific parts of your template.
In the following example, when clicking on the **View more info** button, two events are sent to the Insights API:

- A `click` event with the `eventName` "Article More Info"
- A `click` event with the `eventName` "Article Clicked" (through event propagation)

import MediaClickEvent2 from '/snippets/insights/media-click-event-2.mdx';

<MediaClickEvent2 />

To only send the most specific event per clicked element, you can use [`Event.stopPropagation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) in your event handler.

import MediaClickEvent3 from '/snippets/insights/media-click-event-3.mdx';

<MediaClickEvent3 />
 
When InstantSearch captures a custom `click` event that you defined, it doesn't send the default `click` event.
In the following example, when clicking the **View mores** button, only the "Article More Info Clicked" event is sent.

import MediaClickEvent4 from '/snippets/insights/media-click-event-4.mdx';

<MediaClickEvent4 />

### Track additional click events

For Algolia Recommend and Personalization, capture additional click events
when users select individual products:

- On your home page
- From product recommendations.

To send click events with the Insights client, add the following code
whenever a user clicks on an article---for example,
on your home page.

```js JavaScript
window.aa("clickedObjectIDs", {
  index: "YourIndexName",
  eventName: "Article Clicked",
  objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
});
```
