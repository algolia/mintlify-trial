If you're using Tealium to track user interactions on your website or app, you can set up the Algolia Insights connector to forward [click and conversion events](/guides/send-events/get-started/).

Algolia doesn't provide support for the Tealium connector, including installation or troubleshooting.
If you require help with this connector, refer to the [Tealium documentation](https://docs.tealium.com/server-side-connectors/algolia-insights-connector/) or contact your Tealium team directly.

## Enable `clickAnalytics`

To relate click and conversion events to searches,
Algolia needs a [query ID](/guides/send-events/concepts/event-types/#what-is-the-query-id).
To get the `queryID` parameter for a search,
set the `clickAnalytics` parameter to `true`:

import ClickAnalytics from '/snippets/insights/click-analytics.mdx';

<ClickAnalytics />

## Mapping event parameters

Algolia needs these extra parameters that aren't part of the Tealium event specifications:

| Parameter            | To           | Required? |
| :------------------- | :----------- | :-------- |
| `tealium_event`      | `Event Name` | Yes |
| `index`              | Index        | Yes |
| `tealium_visitor_id` | `User Token` | Yes |
| `queryID`            | `Query ID`   | Yes (for events related to search or browse requests) |
| `product_id`         | `Object IDs` | Yes |
| `position`           | `Positions`  | Yes (for click events related to search requests) |

The next step is to [validate your events](/guides/send-events/guides/validate/).
