  The Google Analytics 4 BigQuery Export connector is a **beta feature** according to [Algolia's Terms of Service ("Beta Services")](https://www.algolia.com/policies/terms/)
</Card>

If you're already using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) on your website,
you can capture [click and conversion events](/guides/send-events/get-started/)
for Algolia's analytics and AI features with the BigQuery Export connector.

Google Analytics lets you export events to BigQuery from where Algolia's connector can import them.

## Set up Google Analytics BigQuery Export

Follow Google's [Set up BigQuery Export](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9823238) guide to link your GA4 property to BigQuery.

When configuring the export, choose the **streaming** option instead of **daily**.
This lets Algolia import events throughout the day instead of after a delay.

With the BigQuery export, Google syncs your GA4 data with BigQuery.
If your GA4 property is new, you need to collect some data first before you can see anything in BigQuery.

## Create a Google Cloud service account and key

Algolia's GA4 BigQuery Export connector needs permission to read from your BigQuery tables so that it can extract the data and import it. 
To read your BigQuery tables,
the connector requires a Google service account and a key.

### Create a Google service account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create service account">
    Follow Google's guide: [Create service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create).

    1. Enter a name and ID for the service account.
    1. Add the **BigQuery Job User** Identity and access management (IAM) role to this service account.
       For more information, see [BigQuery IAM roles and permissions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select dataset">
    In the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery),
    select the dataset with the BigQuery Export, open the **Actions** menu and select **Share > Manage Permissions.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add principal">
    Click **Add Principal**.
    In the **New principals** text box, enter the name of the service account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select role">
    In the **Select a role** menu, select the **BigQuery > BigQuery Data Viewer** role.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create a key attached to the service account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select service account">
    In the Google Cloud console, go to [Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage keys">
    Select your service account.
    Under **Actions**, select **Manage keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new key">
    Select **Add key > Create new key**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select key type">
    In the **Key type** menu, select **JSON**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create key">
    Click **Create**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create GA4 BigQuery Export connection in Algolia

import Dashboard from '/snippets/dashboard.mdx';

<Dashboard />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select data sources" stepNumber={4}>
    On the left sidebar, select <Icon icon="database" iconType="regular" /> **Data sources**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select connector" stepNumber={5}>
    On the [**Connectors**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors/) page, select the [**Google Analytics 4 BigQuery Export**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors/google-analytics-4-bq-export/create) and click **Connect**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure your BigQuery source

The connector's source tells Algolia how to read from the BigQuery tables that Google Analytics syncs to.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create authentication">
    In the **Google Service Account** box,
   select **Create a new Google Service Account authentication**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select roles">
    In the **Create a new Google Service Account authentication** menu,
   upload a key file for a Google service account with these roles:
   **BigQuery Data Viewer** and **BigQuery Job User**.

   Enter a name for this account and click **Create authentication**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter credentials">
    In the **Enter your BigQuery table details** section,
    enter your GCP project ID and BigQuery dataset ID.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a table type">
    Select:

    - **Streaming** if you configured your GA4 BigQuery Export for streaming exports (recommended).
    - **Daily**, if you configured your GA4 BigQuery Export to export daily or if you use both streaming and daily exports.

    <Note>
        If both daily and streaming exports are active,
        the streaming tables expire at the end of each day,
        potentially before they're imported.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter data source name">
    Enter a name for this data source.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click **Save and continue**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure your destination

The connector's destination tells Algolia where to send source data.
For Google Analytics events data the destination is the Insights API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create destination">
    Click **Create a new destination**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an index">
    Enter an index name for Algolia events imported by this connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create credentials">
    To create Algolia credentials for the connector, click **Create one for me**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click **Save and continue**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure event mapping

The mapping section tells Algolia how to map GA4 events to Algolia events.

Algolia only needs a subset of the events from GA4,
depending on the Algolia features you want to use.

The events mapping UI suggests mappings based on events found in your GA4 BigQuery Export that conform to the set of recommended [GA4 ecommerce events](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce).
For other GA4 events you can define a custom mapping.

Most Algolia AI and analytics features rely on events being associated to a search with a [query ID](/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/event-types/#what-is-the-query-id).
For more information about adding query IDs to your GA4 implementation,
see [Attribute events to searches](#attribute-events-to-searches).

Algolia only syncs events with a mapping.
Only create mappings for events that you don't already send to Algolia from other ingestion methods,
or they might be recorded twice.
For example, if you already send _clicked items after searches_ events from the InstantSerach UI library,
don't map these in the connector.

import EventMapping from '/snippets/insights/ga4-event-mapping.mdx';

<EventMapping />

#### Map conversion events

For ecommerce, map these conversion events:

| GA4 | Algolia |
| --- | ------- |
| [`add_to_cart`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events?client_type=gtag#add_to_cart) | `addToCart` |
| [`purchase`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events?client_type=gtag#purchase) | `purchase` |

Other conversion events are optional.
For example, if you track additional conversion events, such as _add to wish list_,
you can map them to the generic Algolia `conversion` event.

#### Send GA4 user tokens in search requests

Google Analytics' persistent, anonymous user token is part of the imported GA4 events.
For analytics and Personalization, you need to send the same user token with your search requests.

To retrieve the GA user token, see [Google Analytics user token](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/#google-analytics).
Add it as `userToken` parameter to your search requests.

```js JavaScript
const algoliasearch = require('algoliasearch');
const client = algoliasearch('YourApplicationID', 'YourWriteAPIKey');
const index = client.initIndex('test_index');
const userToken = getGoogleAnalyticsUserIdFromBrowserCookie('_ga');

// Use the GA4 user token when performing searches.
index.search('test', {
    userToken: userToken,
});

const loggedInUser = '...';

index.search('test', {
    userToken: loggedInUser || userToken,
});
```

### Create your task

To start syncing GA4 events with Algolia, click **Create task**.
With a task type **streaming**, events will be regularly read from your BigQuery tables.
This isn't the same as Google Analytics' [**streaming**](#set-up-google-analytics-bigquery-export),
which refers to exporting events from GA4 to BigQuery.

<Note>
The Google Analytics BigQuery connector doesn't backfill events.
Once you create your connection, only new events written to BigQuery get synced.
GA4 events written to BigQuery before the connection aren't synced.
</Note>

## Check your GA4 BigQuery Export connector in Algolia

After creating your connection,
use Algolia's **Connector Debugger** and **Events Debugger** to see the progress of the sync.

### Connector debugger

On the **Connectors** page, open the [**Connector Debugger**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors/debugger) tab to ensure that your events get imported from Google Analytics.

If your events aren't imported, the following section includes some troubleshooting steps.

#### Check for mapping errors

If you don't use the recommended GA4 fields,
you may need to edit your mapping.

For example, if your GA4 events don't use _items_, and you don't adjust your mapping accordingly,
you might receive an error similar to:

```txt*
Algolia API error [422] {"status":422,"message":"Event should specify either some ObjectIDs or some Filters"}
```

### Events debugger

The events debugger lets you check if the Insights API correctly receives the events from the connector.

On the left sidebar, select <Icon icon="database" iconType="regular" /> **Data sources** and 
open the [**Debugger**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/debugger/) tab.

For more information, see [Validate your events](/guides/send-events/guides/validate/).

## Attribute events to searches

Each Algolia search has a unique identifier: the query ID.
It is used to attribute click and conversion events to searches.
By default, GA4 doesn't track the query ID.
To link GA4 events to their originating search, [keep track of the current query ID](/guides/send-events/guides/queryid/) and recording it as a custom event attribute in GA4, for example `algolia_query_id`.

```js JavaScript
// This will be turned into a click event associated with a search.
gtag('event', 'select_item', {
    // We use algolia_query_id to not conflict with GA's query_id.
    algolia_query_id: 'tracked query id',
    items: [{
      item_id: 'object1',
      item_name: 'red shoes',
    }],
});

// For purchases, different items can be associated with different searches.
gtag('event', 'purchase', {
    items: [{
        item_id: 'object1',
        algolia_query_id: 'object1 query',
    }, {
        item_id: 'object2',
        algolia_query_id: 'object2 query',
    }]
});
```
