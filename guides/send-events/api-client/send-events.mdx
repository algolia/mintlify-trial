## (Optional) Handle known users for Personalization

For effective personalization, you need to identify users across sessions.
It's best to use an identifier from your authentication system after users signed in.

For more information, see [User token](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/).

## (Optional) Send view events for Personalization

    index: "YourIndexName",
    eventName: "Item Viewed",

});
