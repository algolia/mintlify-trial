  Learn how to use Dynamic Re-Ranking to re-rank and promote popular products on category pages.
---

You can use [Algolia's Dynamic Re-Ranking](/guides/algolia-ai/re-ranking/) feature to find trends in your users' behavior.
Based on users' interaction throughout search and browse, Dynamic Re-Ranking improves the relevance of your category pages by boosting results that are trending or rising in popularity.

Once you set up the **category pages** and successfully **send click and conversion** events (requires coding) to Algolia, Algolia starts using this data to detect trends in your user behavior.
No coding is required to enable [Dynamic Re-Ranking on category pages](/guides/algolia-ai/dynamic-re-ranking/re-rank-category-pages/).

Dynamic Re-Ranking refreshes each query's ranking every 24 hours.
It always takes the last 30 days into account, meaning it's based on a sliding window of the most recent analytics data.

### Enable Dynamic Re-Ranking on category pages

Configure the following options from the [Dynamic Re-Ranking page in the dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/reranking/).

* Opt in an index for Dynamic Re-Ranking.

* Select the correct events source index (optional).

* Pick your category page identifier by choosing a **Browsing Facet**.

* Adjust weight to recent events (optional)

* Simulate Dynamic Re-Ranking.

* Activate Dynamic Re-Ranking.

<Note>
  You can see re-ranked results only after Algolia has received enough search traffic and click and conversion events.
  For a record to be promoted for a given query, it must gather **at least 20 clicks or two conversions during the 30 days time window.**
</Note>

#### Opt in an index for Dynamic Re-Ranking

Go to the [Dynamic Re-Ranking page](https://dashboard.algolia.com/reranking/) in the Algolia dashboard and select the index you want to use for Dynamic Re-Ranking.

#### Optional: select the correct events source index

Under **Dynamic Re-ranking**, click **Events source index** and update the source index where you send your click and conversion events in production.
If you need to use a different source for your events, you can select the correct events source index.

A main use case for selecting an alternative source index is when you have a staging index that replaces the production index every day for atomic reindexing.
In this case, you should enable re-ranking on both the staging and target production indices as source events, given that the production index already receives events.

#### Pick your category page identifier by choosing a "browsing facet"

Under Dynamic Re-Ranking, click **Browsing facet** and update the browsing filter to the category page identifier you indexed in the dataset.
A **category page identifier** is a unique identifier that references a particular category page.
Possible identifiers include `collections`, `categories`, `categoryId`, and `categoryPageId`.
Check with your team to make sure the browsing filter is referencing the correct filter used in the query to generate the category page in the frontend UI.

#### Optional: adjust weight to recent events

By default, the [event freshness](/guides/algolia-ai/dynamic-re-ranking/#give-more-weight-to-recent-events-event-freshness) setting is enabled to handle seasonality and shorter trends.
Although can turn off this setting, you should usually leave it on.

#### Simulate Dynamic Re-Ranking

Once Algolia receives enough search traffic and click and conversion events, you can assess the effect of re-ranking on your search results and browse page in the simulator.
You should use the simulator before activating the feature in production.

#### Activate Dynamic Re-Ranking

Before activating Dynamic Re-Ranking, you can turn off re-ranking for specific records.
To prevent promoting popular items that are out of stock or no longer listed, select a filter value, for example `instock=true`.

Click **Activate**:

### A/B test Dynamic Re-Ranking on category pages

To measure performance of the re-ranking approach, it's important to launch the A/B test directly from the re-ranking section of the UI and not from the A/B test tab in the dashboard.
This ensures all the settings are configured correctly and that you are measuring the performance only on the pages with enough traffic and where re-ranking rules apply.
