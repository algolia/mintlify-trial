title: Dynamic Synonym Suggestions
description: |-
  Use AI to automate finding the best synonyms for your search.
---

Synonyms are words that share a similar meaning.
Adding synonyms to your search helps your users find relevant results
even if they use different words to express the same concept.
For example, by adding a synonym for _trousers_ and _pants_,
a search for either term returns identical results.

</Card>

## Get started

<Note>
    Dynamic Synonym Suggestions are available on [Build and Premium plans](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).
</Note>

To activate Dynamic Synonym Suggestions for one of your indices:

import Dashboard from '/snippets/dashboard.mdx';

<Dashboard />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Activate AI synonyms" stepNumber={4}>
    Open the [**AI Synonyms**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/ai-synonyms/) page and select **Activate for this index**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Send user token with your searches

To find suggestions, Algolia determines how often users rewrite a search term.
To make that more accurate, send user tokens with your search requests.
For more information, see [Distinguish users for analytics](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/search-analytics/guides/usertoken/).

## Review synonyms

The **Suggested Synonyms** tab shows new suggestions.
To show all suggestions, turn off the **Show only new synonyms** option.

Each suggestion shows more information, such as a confidence score.
If you're [sending click and conversion events](/guides/send-events/get-started/),
you can compare click-through and conversion rates for both alternatives.

## Accept or decline suggestions

To accept a suggestion, click **Add to configuration** (`✓`).
If you don't want to add this suggestion to all replicas of this index, turn off the **Forward to replicas** option at the top.
You can edit accepted suggestions in the **Accepted suggestions** tab.

To decline a suggestion, click **Decline this suggestion** (`x`).
You can edit and accept declined suggestions in the **Declined suggestions** tab.

<Note>
    After accepting a suggestion, only edit it in the dashboard, not with the API.
</Note>

## Change synonym types

By default, the AI suggests adding regular two-way synonyms.
To change to another [synonym type](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/),
hover over the suggestion and click the **Edit** button.
Then, click **Select Type** (`⇔`) and select a synonym type.
