## Track additional click events

For Algolia Recommend and Personalization, capture additional click events
when users select individual items:

- On your home page
- From recommendations

To send click events with the Insights client, add the following code
whenever a user clicks on an article---for example,
on your homepage.

```js JavaScript
window.aa("clickedObjectIDs", {
index: "YourIndexName",
eventName: "Article Clicked",
objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
});
```
