    ## Server-side rendering

    Server-side rendering (SSR) lets you generate HTML from InstantSearch components on the server.
    Before loading the page for the first time, a backend server makes an initial request to Algolia, renders it as HTML, and sends it to the browser.

    SSR is beneficial in slow network conditions because **the browser directly loads an HTML document containing search results.**
    There's no need to wait for all the JavaScript assets to load before seeing the search results.
