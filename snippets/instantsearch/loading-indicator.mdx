## Add a loading indicator

Consider a user accessing your app in a subway:

1. They type some characters
1. Nothing happens
1. They wait, but still, nothing happens

However, you can enhance the user experience by displaying a loading indicator to indicate something _is_ happening.
The indicator will display slightly after the last query has been sent to Algolia.
