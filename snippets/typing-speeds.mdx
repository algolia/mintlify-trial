### Select a debounce delay

The optimal debouncing delay should match your audience's typing speed
(typically 30 words per minute (WPM) on mobile devices and 40 WPM on desktop devices).
If the delay is too short, users still see flashes of content.
If the delay is too long, the time between keypresses and results becomes too long.

200&nbsp;ms is the preferred debounce delay.
Delays of over 300&nbsp;ms will start degrading the user experience.
