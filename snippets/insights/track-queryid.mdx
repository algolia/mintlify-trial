## Keep track of query IDs

Conversion events are often triggered outside of the search results page.
In order to correctly attribute which query is responsible for a conversion, it is necessary to keep track of the query ID
returned when a search is performed so that it can be included in conversion events.

To relate the conversion events back to the search request made on your search results or category pages,
you need to [keep track of the query IDs](/guides/send-events/guides/queryid) across your pages.
