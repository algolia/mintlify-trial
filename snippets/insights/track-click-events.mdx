## Track click events

Click events capture when users indicate they want to view
specific pieces of content. Add the following code to track a user navigating to
a piece of content from a search results page:

```js JavaScript
window.aa("clickedObjectIDsAfterSearch", {
    index: "YourIndexName",
    eventName: "Item Clicked",

    // Fields from the search response.
    queryID: "YourQueryID",
    objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
    positions: [1],
});
```

In `clickedObjectIdsAfterSearch`:

- `queryID` is used by Algolia to relate the event to a prior search or browse event.
- `objectIDs` should contain the ID of the article. This can be retrieved from the `objectID` field of the `hits` array returned from the search request.
- `positions` indicates the position of the item in the search results. For example, if the user clicked on the top result on the page, positions should be `[1]`.

If a user found a piece of content without performing a search---for example, they
browsed there from elsewhere on your site, add the following code to track that:

```js JavaScript
window.aa("clickedObjectIDs", {
    index: "YourIndexName",
    eventName: "Item Clicked",
    objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
})
    ```
