An example of a conversion event that may be relevant to your media site:

```js JavaScript
// A user reached the bottom of an article page
window.aa("convertedObjectIDsAfterSearch", {
eventName: "Article Read",
index: "YourIndexName",
queryID: "query-1",
objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
});
```

The `window.aa` object is the API client for the Insights API and is globally available
if you enabled automatic events collection.

In `convertedObjectIDsAfterSearch`:

- `queryID` is used by Algolia to relate the event to a prior search.
- `objectIDs` indicates which items were part of the conversion.The `objectID` parameter is included in the search response for each hit.

If the event isn't directly related to a search, for example, it's triggered on the homepage,
use the `convertedObjectIDs` method instead.

```js JavaScript
// A user watched a video
window.aa("convertedObjectIDs", {
eventName: "Video Watched",
index: "YourIndexName",
objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
});
```

Some other examples of conversion events are:

- `Article Bookmarked`: a user bookmarked an article.
- `Article Liked`: a user liked an article.
- `Article Recommended`: a user recommended an article.
- `Playlist Followed`: a user followed a playlist.
- `Author Followed`: a user followed an author.
- `Brand Followed`: a user followed a brand.
