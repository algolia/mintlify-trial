    For Algolia Recommend and Personalization, capture additional click events
    when users select individual items:

    - On your home page
    - From recommendations

    To send click events with the Insights client, add the following code
    whenever a user clicks on an article---for example,
    on your home page.

    ```js JavaScript
    window.aa("clickedObjectIDs", {
    index: "YourIndexName",
    eventName: "Article Clicked",
    objectIDs: ["objectID-1"],
    });
    ```
