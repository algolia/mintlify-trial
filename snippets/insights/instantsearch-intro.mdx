## Before you begin

To follow this guide, you need to build both search results and category pages with one of these UI libraries:

- InstantSearch.js version 4.59 or later
- React InstantSearch version 7.2.1 or later
- Vue InstantSearch version 4.12.0 or later

For other methods of collecting events, see [Get started with events](/guides/send-events/get-started).

### Manage the Insights library

InstantSearch loads the [`search-insights`](/api-reference/insights-api/) library for you from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).
You don't need to install it or set it up yourself.

If you're using a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) to protect your site and you want to let InstantSearch load [`search-insights`](/doc/api-client/methods/insights/) for you, make sure to add `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` in your list of trusted sources for JavaScript.

```txt
script-src https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/
```

If you prefer hosting your own version of `search-insights`, you can add it to your project:

1. Install the Insights client
1. Initialize the Insights client (optional)

InstantSearch doesn't load `search-insights` when it detects it on the page.

## Enable events collection

You can enable the automatic collection of events from your InstantSearch apps
in the Algolia dashboard (without coding),
or when setting up your InstantSearch app (with coding).

Enabling automatic events collection takes care of the following:

- Add the [`search-insights`](/api-reference/insights-api/) library to your project and make it globally available as `window.aa`
- Set an anonymous [`userToken`](/guides/send-events/concepts/user-token/) for sending events to the Insights API _and_ for search requests
- Include the [`queryID`](/guides/send-events/concepts/event-types/#what-is-the-query-id) parameter in the search response
- Send default click and view events for your InstantSearch widgets

Go to the [Events hub](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/) in the Algolia dashboard to check
the default events arriving from your website or app.
For more information, see [Validate your events](/guides/send-events/guides/validate).

### No code

1. Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/settings) and select your Algolia application.
2. On the left sidebar, select **Data sources** > **Events** > **Settings**.
3. Click **Enable automatic events collection**.

### Code

Enable the `insights` option:

<CodeGroup>

```diff InstantSearch.js
    const search = instantsearch({
    searchClient,
    indexName: "YourIndexName",
+   insights: true,
    });
    // Add your InstantSearch widgets here
    search.start();
```

```diff React InstantSearch
    <InstantSearch
    searchClient={searchClient}
    indexName="YourIndexName"
+   insights={true}
    >
    {/* Add your InstantSearch widgets here */}
    </InstantSearch>
```

```diff Vue InstantSearch
    <template>
    <ais-instant-search
        :index-name="YourIndexName"
        :search-client="searchClient"
+     :insights="true"
    >
        <!-- Add your InstantSearch widgets here -->
    </ais-instant-search>
    </template>
```

</CodeGroup>

import EventsToTrack from '/snippets/insights/events-to-track.mdx';

You may want to send events that arn.t automatically captured by InstantSearch widgets.
