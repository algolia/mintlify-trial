  Learn how to check the status of indexing operations for Algolia's commercetools connector.
---

After triggering a [full reindex](/integration/commercetools/get-started/configuration/#trigger-a-full-reindex) in the tasks list, you can check the progress of an indexing operation
in the [Connector Debugger](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors/debugger).

## Run overview

The **Runs** list shows details, such as the status, the source, the destination, and a time for each run.

## Run details

Select a run from the list by clicking on its row to open the **Details** panel, which shows the progress and details of an individual run including:

- The identifiers of the run and the task
- The **Status** and the **Outcome** of the run
- When the run has started and finished
- A panel with records and errors details

## Record/Error details

Select a record or an error in the **Events** panel to display more information about it.
