## Before you begin

To connect commercetools and Algolia, you need a commercetools [account](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/accounts) and [store](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/stores) with administrator access.

You also need an Algolia app with administrator access.
You can [create one for free](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-your-apps/).

## Create a commercetools API client

To let Algolia interact with your store, you must first set up a new commercetools API client:

1. Sign in to the Merchant Center of your commercetools project, to which you want to add Algolia.

1. On the sidebar, go to **Settings > Developer settings**.

1. Click **Create new API client**.

1. Enter a name for the API client.

1. Select the API scopes for the new client. You need at least the following scopes:

   - All items under the **View** column
   - **View API clients**
   - **Subscriptions**

1. Click **Create API client**.

1. Copy or save the curl command.
   You need it to configure your commercetools integration in Algolia.

For more information, see [Get your API client](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started/create-api-client) in the commercetools documentation.

## Connect commercetools in the Algolia dashboard

1. Sign in to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/users/sign_in).
1. On the left sidebar, select **Data sources**.
1. Click **Connectors**.
1. Find the **commercetools** connector and click **Connect**.
