  Learn how to debug issues with Algolia extension for Magento 2.
---

Sometimes, things don't go as expected.
As a developer, logs are a great way to figure out why things are not running smoothly.
That's why the extension provides the ability to enable logging.
You can turn logging on by navigating to **Stores > Configuration > Algolia Search > Credentials & Setup**.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Warning>
  **Never turn logging on in production!** It can create huge amounts of data and exhaust your server resources quickly. You should only enable logging during development to debug certain processes.
</Warning>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

With logging enabled, the extension creates info type logs. By default, Magento writes info type logs to the following files:

- `var/log/system.log`
- `var/log/debug.log`

The logs capture information on the following events:

- Full reindex of products
- Rebuilding a page of products
- Loading products' collection
- Indexing of a single product
- Indexing of a collection of products
- Beginning and ending of sending data to Algolia
- Beginning and ending of removing data from Algolia
- Beginning and ending of emulation
- Image loading exceptions that are thrown
- Miscellaneous errors and exceptions
