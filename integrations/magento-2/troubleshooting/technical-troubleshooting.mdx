Magento is highly configurable.
While this is Magento's core strength, it's difficult to create an out-of-the-box extension that fits every single use case.
Every website in Magento is unique, and thus it behaves unique as well.

Sometimes, circumstances can lead to issues during the indexing process handled by our extensions.
These circumstances could be a third party plug-in, Magento configuration, server configuration, bad practices, and more.

In case your installation has any issue, please walk through this guide to learn how to debug our extension.

## Before you begin

Ensure the issue isn't addressed by one of the following:

- [Indexing](/integration/magento-2/how-it-works/indexing/)
- [Indexing queue](/integration/magento-2/how-it-works/indexing-queue/)
- [SKU reindexing form](/integration/magento-2/how-it-works/sku-reindexing-form/)
- [Troubleshooting data, index or queue issues](/integration/magento-2/troubleshooting/data-indexes-queues/)

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- Installing our Magento 2 extension
- Configuring the credentials
- Configuring the product, category, pages and suggestions settings
- Configuring facets
- Understanding the indexing process
- Configuring the Indexing Queue
- Comprehending the most common issues related to indexing

## Remaining issues

Any remaining issues will probably fall in one of the following categories:

- Products are visible in the back-office, but don't show up on the frontend
- Prices, images, and other attributes don't seem to be updated
- The Indexing Queue remains full and doesn't seem to be processed

These issues fall either in [Common Frontend Issues](/integration/magento-2/troubleshooting/front-end-issues/) or [Common Backend Issues](/integration/magento-2/troubleshooting/back-end-issues/).
Debugging these issues may require technical knowledge.
