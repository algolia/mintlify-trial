title: Upgrading to a new version
description: |-
  Learn how to upgrade the Algolia extension for Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce.
---

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for our extension. Our recommendation is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to update Algolia extension for both Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce.
See [Upgrade an extension](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/howtos/install-components.html#upgrade-an-extension) in the Magento developer documentation for more information.

## Upgrade to a new patch version

Patch versions typically include backward-compatible bug fixes.
To ensure optimal performance, you should periodically check the [releases page](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-magento-2/releases) and apply patches as soon as possible.

```sh sh
composer update algolia/algoliasearch-magento-2
```

## Upgrade to a new major or minor version

Both major and minor version upgrade processes are the same. Specify the version number you are upgrading to.

Here is an example:

```sh sh
composer require algolia/algoliasearch-magento-2 "~3.13.0" --update-with-dependencies
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  You should use tilde constraints, especially if you have customized your search implementation. By doing this, `composer update` only pulls available _patch_ release updates while allowing you to selectively upgrade to _major_ and _minor_ versions in a controlled environment where you can test the impact of the upgrade on your customizations.
</Note>

## For all upgrades

Updates to the extension may include data or schema patches or new dependencies.

After running Composer, make sure to run the following CLI commands to complete the upgrade.

```sh sh
bin/magento setup:di:compile
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```

## After upgrading

After updating the extension, save the configuration again **even if you didn't change the settings**: go to **Stores > Configuration > Algolia Search** and click **Save Config** at the top right.

After saving the configuration, [reindex your Magento indices](/integration/magento-2/getting-started/quick-start/#indexing).

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Warning>
  Read the extension's [change log](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-magento-2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for information about the differences between versions and any potential extra steps.
</Warning>

If you're using the [indexing queue](/integration/magento-2/how-it-works/indexing-queue/), clear it after upgrading the extension, and perform a full reindex. This prevents errors with `call_user_func_array()` from deleted or renamed job methods.

To clear your indexing queue:

1. Go to **Stores > Algolia Search > Indexing Queue** and click **Clear Queue** at the top right
1. To perform a complete reindex, run the following command from the root of your Magento project:

   ```sh sh
   php bin/magento indexer:reindex algolia_products algolia_categories algolia_pages algolia_suggestions algolia_additional_sections
   ```
