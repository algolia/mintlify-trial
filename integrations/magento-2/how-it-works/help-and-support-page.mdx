  Learn how to troubleshoot and sort out the issues you may experience.

The extension's Help & Support page is a good place to start when troubleshooting any potential issues with the extension.
The page can be found by navigating to **Stores > Configuration > Algolia Search > Help & Support**.

By default, the Help & Support page offers the most visited documentation pages and forum topics, and a list of video tutorials.
The video tutorials can guide new users through the extension and reveal some of the advanced features without having to read through all the documentation.

## Search

At the top of the page, a search bar is displayed.
This allows you to search through the official documentation and community forum topics to quickly find a solution to any potential issue.

## Contact

If you have a [Grow or Premium pricing plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing), you're eligible for direct email support and a 'Contact us' link will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
This link will lead to a form which is sent to the [Algolia support](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
