Algolia offers [search analytics](/guides/search-analytics/overview/) to help you understand how your search meets the expectations of your users.
The Algolia extension for Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce comes with its own Analytics dashboard that shows some of this data.
Go to **Stores > Algolia Search > Analytics Overview** to get started.

## Filtering data

You can filter analytics data by store view, index type, and date range.
The index types are limited to _products_, _categories_, and _pages_.

By default, Algolia retains the last 90 days of your analytics history.
You can extend your analytics retention up to 365 days.

<Note>
  Extended analytics retention is available as an add-on to your [pricing plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).

## Metrics

The Analytics page provides the following metrics out of the box:

| Metric                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total searches**      | How many searches were performed. As-you-type searches are aggregated. For example, if a user searches for "iPad", the queries `i`, `iP`, `iPa`, and `iPad` count as one search                                                        |
| **Users**               | How many unique users performed a search                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **No results rate**     | Percentage of searches that returned 0 results. The lower, the better                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Daily searches**      | A bar chart displaying the number of searches per day in the selected date range. You can reveal more daily statistics by hovering over each bar                                                                                       |
| **Popular searches**    | Which searches are performed most often                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Popular results**     | Results that are displayed most often in the results after a search                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **No results searches** | Search queries that returned 0 results. Consider [adding synonyms](/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/) to your index, or improve keywords in your data set to reduce the number of no results searches. |

## Click and conversion analytics
