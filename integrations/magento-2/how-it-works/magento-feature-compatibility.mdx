The Algolia extension for Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce is compatible with these external modules.

## Magento Inventory (MSI)

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  The code for the `Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory` module is a community-developed module available on [GitHub](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-inventory-magento-2). Though Algolia is a contributor to this repository, there is no product roadmap for this module and it's not aligned with the Algolia/Magento integration product releases.
</Note>

The Algolia extension supports the [Magento Inventory](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/module-reference/module-inventory/) module,
also known as Multi-Source Inventory (MSI).

See [Inventory Management](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/inventory/) in the Magento developer documentation for more information.

The MSI features include:

- Different configurations for merchants whose inventory originates from single or multiple sources
- Stock tracking through assigned sources
- Concurrent checkout protection
- Shipment matching algorithms

As a consequence, you can create multiple inventory sources and stocks to manage the availability of products in your stores.

### Compatibility

MSI changed the way a product is determined to be in stock or not.
To support the new behavior and to keep backwards compatibility with older versions of the Magento 2 integration,
Algolia provides an optional module, `Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory`.

You can download this module separately with Composer and use it in addition to the Algolia extension.

You can use the `Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory` module with version 1.12 or later of the Algolia extension.
To decide which version of the `Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory` you need to install,
check the [compatibility](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-inventory-magento-2#compatibility) on GitHub.

### Requirements

You can use `Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory` if:

- You're using Magento version 2.3 or later
- You're using multiple sources/stocks to manage your inventory

<Note>
  If you don't use MSI, adding the `Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory` module won't break your indexing process,
  but it may slow it down. You should only install the module if you're using MSI.

### Installing the Algolia\_AlgoliaSearchInventory module

Install the `Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory` module with Composer:

```sh sh
composer require algolia/algoliasearch-inventory-magento-2
php bin/magento module:enable Algolia_AlgoliaSearchInventory
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy # in case you're on production mode
```

Now, your multiple sources and stocks are handled as you expect and you can continue to use the Algolia extension.
