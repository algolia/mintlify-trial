  Learn how the frontend code works in Algolia extension for Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce.
---

The Algolia extension for Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce comes with an Autocomplete search-as-you-type menu
and an InstantSearch results page. This guide explains how you can configure both components in your Magento Admin panel.

## Autocomplete menu

The Algolia extension uses the [`autocomplete`](/api-reference/widgets/autocomplete/js/) InstantSearch widget. By default, this Autocomplete menu suggests products, categories, and pages when a user is searching.
To configure which and how many items are displayed, go to **Stores > Algolia Search > Autocomplete Menu**.

For deeper customization of the Autocomplete menu, you can edit the template.

## Results page

For displaying search results, the Algolia extension uses [InstantSearch.js](/api-reference/widgets/js/).

By default, the results page isn't shown.
If you want to use the results page, your theme must provide a `top.search` and a `content` block.
You may have to adjust the design of your theme to integrate the results page.

To enable the results page, go to **Stores > Algolia Search > InstantSearch Results Page**.

By default, the following widgets are enabled:

- **Hits**. A list of products matching user queries
- **Pagination**. Navigation links between the results pages
- **Sorting**. A switch to toggle between different ways of sorting products
- **Price Range Slider**. A slider to refine the price range of the products
- **Hierarchical Menu**. A menu to refine the category of the products

To add other widgets to the results page, edit the template.

To configure the displayed data and refinements, go to **Stores > Algolia Search > InstantSearch Results Page**.

On this page, you can configure the **attributes used as facets**:

These determine which filters are available for users.

You can also configure the **attributes available for sorting** on this page:

Each sorting attribute in Magento generates either a standard or virtual [replica index](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/replicas/) in Algolia, based on whether the **Enable Virtual Replica?** setting is selected.
