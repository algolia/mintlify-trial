  Index Shopify's metafields.

Algolia supports indexing Shopify's [metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields).

To learn how to add metafields to your products and collections,
see [Adding metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields/metafield-definitions) in the Shopify documentation.

As an alternative, consider using [named tags](/integration/shopify/sending-and-managing-data/named-tags/).
They let you add extra attributes to your products and variants, without having to configure metafield indexing settings.

## Index metafields

1. In your Shopify admin, go to the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app.
1. Open the **Indexing** tab.
1. Go to the **Metafields Indexing** section.
1. Enter a title, namespace, and key for the metafield you want to add.
   You should be able to find this information in the app you use to manage your metafields.
1. Optional (only for products): select [**Use as facet**](#metafields-as-facets) if you want to use this metafield for faceting or filtering.
1. Optional: [convert the type](#type-conversion) of the metafield to a number, a string array, or a JSON encoded field.
1. Click **Add**. If you're done adding metafields, click **Save**.

## Metafields as facets

For your products, you can select metafields as facets.
If you select the **Use as facet** option when adding or editing a metafield,
the metafield is _inactive_ at first.
Inactive facets aren't shown in your index in the Algolia dashboard.

To activate the facet, go to the **Search Options** tab,
click **InstantSearch - Results page powered by Algolia > Customize** and [configure your facets](/integration/shopify/getting-started/configuration/#faceting)

## Type conversion

Shopify metafields can only be `integer` or `string` types.
For your Algolia index, you can convert them to the following types:

### Number

Converts strings to:

- Integers: `"100" => 100`
- Decimals: `"1.2" => 1.2`

### String array

Converts a string to an array of strings, split on commas.

- To include commas in a string, wrap the string in quotes: `abc, "def,ghi"`
- To include quotes in a string, wrap the string in quotes and escape the quotes: `abc, "def\"ghi"`
- To include backslashes in a string, wrap the string in quotes and escape the backslashes: `abc, "def\\ghi"`

### JSON Encoded

Decode a JSON-encoded string.

Transform this string:

```txt txt
"[{\"value\":2.0,\"unit\":\"oz\"},{\"value\":3.0,\"unit\":\"oz\"}]"
```

Into this record:

```json json
[
  { "value": 2.0, "unit": "oz" },
  { "value": 3.0, "unit": "oz" }
]
```

## Schema

In your Algolia index, metafields are added to your records as `meta` attribute,
which itself is also a (nested) JSON object.

For example, a record with three metafields `colors.main`, `colors.secondary`, and `contact.partner`:

```jsonc jsonc
{
  "title": "Awesome dress",
  // ... Other attributes
  "meta": {
    "colors": {
      "main": "white",
      "secondary": "gold",
    },
    "contact": {
      "partner": "sellonlineshop.co",
    },
  },
}
```

You can use any of these metafields in your Algolia index configuration.
To select a metafield, use `meta.namespace.key`, such as `meta.colors.primary`.

## Product and variant metafields

If a variant has metafields, their values override the metafields of its parent product.

## Multiple language support

Some Shopify apps that help with translations store their translated data within metafields, which can be indexed by the Shopify app.

To add support for multiple languages:

1. Add all the required translated data within metafields associated with the product
1. [Index those metafields](#index-metafields)
1. \[Optional.] Depending on the user's chosen language, display this data by modifying the relevant product template ([InstantSearch](/integration/shopify/building-search-ui/instant-search/) and [Autocomplete](/integration/shopify/building-search-ui/autocomplete/)).
