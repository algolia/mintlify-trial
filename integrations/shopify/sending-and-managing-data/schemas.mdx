  Understand the schema Algolia uses to index your Shopify data.
---

Algolia transforms and stores your Shopify data in a format that's optimal for your search experience.

## Products and variants

Algolia stores [variants](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/variants), not products,
in an index `PREFIX_products`. The default prefix is `shopify`.
Variants are stored as independent records.

For products without variants, the product attributes are first transformed into a schema that parallels the structure of the variant's schema and then uploaded.

<Note>
  The Algolia AI Search & Discovery app only supports indexing products in the "Online Store" sales channel.

### Product variant schema

Algolia stores your product variants in the following format:

```jsoncjsonc
{
  objectID,                       // Variant id (unique identifier also used by Algolia)
  sku,
  barcode,
  id,                             // Product id
  title,                          // Name of the product
  variant_title,                  // Name of the variant
  product_type,
  vendor,
  handle,                         // URL handle for the product
  tags,
  named_tags: {                   // Key value association from tags like this: "key:value" (See Named tags section)
    <TAG_KEY>
  },
  body_html_safe,                 // Description (without HTML, truncated to 2,000 characters)
  compare_at_price,               // Initial price
  price,                          // Actual (optionally discounted) price
  price_ratio,
  price_range,
  variants_count,                 // Total count of the variants of the related product
  variants_min_price,             // Min price of all the variants of the related product (only relevant with distinct enabled)
  variants_max_price,             // Max price of all the variants of the related product (only relevant with distinct enabled)
  variants_compare_at_price_min   // Min compare_at_price of all the variants of the related product
  variants_compare_at_price_max   // Max compare_at_price of all the variants of the related product
  option1,                        // Variant option 1
  option2,                        // Variant option 2
  option3,                        // Variant option 3
  options: {                      // Hash containing the option `names: value`
    <OPTION_NAME>
  },
  option_names,                   // Array containing the option names, in order
  requires_shipping,
  taxable,
  grams,
  weight,                         // Weight with its original unit
  image,
  product_image,
  inventory_quantity,             // Number of available items in the inventory
  position,                       // Position of the variant in the list of products
  template_suffix,
  meta: {                         // Metafields (See Metafields section)
    namespace1: {
      key1,
      key2
    },
  },
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  published_at,
  recently_ordered_count,          // How much have recently been ordered : useful for ranking
  collections: [
    'collection-1-handle',         // Array of product collection handles
    // ...
  ],
  collection_ids: [
    'collection-1-id',             // Array of product collection IDs
    // ...
  ],
  locations_inventory: {
    key1: value1,                  // Object with location_id:quantity - location_id is auto-generated
    key2: value2
  }
}
```

The `image` attribute uses the variant's image if it exists,
otherwise it uses the first image of the associated product.

### Recently ordered count

The recently ordered count attribute represents all orders **since the last full reindex**.
Initially, it doesn't exist when the index is first created.
It gets added when you sell products.
For example, if a customer buys two blue t-shirts in size S,
the value of this attribute increases by two.

The recently ordered count attribute is used for the **Most Popular** [sort order](/integration/shopify/getting-started/configuration/#sort-orders).

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Warning>
  The `recently_ordered_count` attribute is reset during a full reindex.
  Therefore, it's a count of all orders since the last reindex, not since the beginning.
  The `recently_ordered_count` attribute is preserved during [real-time indexing](/integration/shopify/sending-and-managing-data/introduction-to-shopify-indexing/#automatic-updates).
</Warning>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Searchable attributes for products

By default, these attributes are [searchable](/guides/managing-results/must-do/searchable-attributes/).
They're ranked in order of relevance—for example, results with a match in the `vendor` attribute rank before results with a match in the `title` attribute:

1. `unordered(vendor)`
1. `unordered(title)`
1. `unordered(variant_title)`
1. `product_type`
1. `unordered(tags)`
1. `unordered(handle)`
1. `sku`
1. `barcode`
1. `unordered(body_html_safe)`

### Show products instead of variants

To only show the most relevant variant instead of all variants in your search results:

1. Go to the Shopify admin and go to the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app.
1. On the **Search options** tab, in the **Variants** section, select **Show products instead of variants**.

### Remove products from search results

Products are indexed if they:

- Have the "Active" status and are published to a sales channel
- Don't have a publishing date in the future
- Don't include `algolia-ignore` in their list of tags
- Don't include `[hidden]` in their title

To hide a product from the search results—for example, a product that's not released yet,
you can make one of these changes:

- Add `algolia-ignore` to the product's list of tags
- Add `[hidden]` to its title
- Set the status to "Draft"
- Archive the product

### Remove variants from search results

To remove a variant from the search results add `[hidden]` to the variant's name.
The position of the string `[hidden]` in the title doesn't matter.

For example, if you want to hide a variant "blue" from the search results,
change its title to `blue [hidden]` or `[hidden] blue`.

## Collections

If you enabled [Collection pages](/integration/shopify/advanced-customization/collection-search-page/),
Algolia stores your collections in a dedicated index `PREFIX_collections`. The default prefix is `shopify`.
The relationship between products and collections is stored in the product records,
in the `collection_ids` and `collections` attributes.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  The Algolia AI Search & Discovery app only supports indexing collections in the "Online Store" sales channel.
</Note>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Collections schema

Algolia stores your collections in the following format:

```jsoncjsonc
{
  objectID,           // Collection id (in Shopify and Algolia)
  title,
  handle,             // URL handle
  body_html,          // Description (with HTML, truncated to 2,000 characters)
  body_html_safe,     // Description (without HTML, truncated to 2,000 characters)
  image,
  products_count,     // Product count in the collection (not updated in real time)
  template_suffix,
  meta: {             // Metafields (See Metafields section)
    namespace1: {
      key1,
      key2
    },
  },
  updated_at
}
```

### Searchable attributes for collections

The following attributes are [searchable](/guides/managing-results/must-do/searchable-attributes/).
They're ranked in order of relevance—for example, results with a match in the `title` attribute rank before results with a match in the `handle` attribute:

1. `title`
1. `handle`
1. `unordered(body_html_safe)`

### Remove collections from search results

Collections are indexed if they:

- Are published to a sales channel
- Don't have a publishing date in the future
- Have at least one product
- Don't include `[hidden]` in their title

To remove a collection from the search results,
you can:

- Exclude it from the "Online Store" sales channel
- Add `[hidden]` to the collection title

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  Hiding a collection from search results won't hide the products within the collection.
</Note>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Blogs

If you select **Index blog posts** (on the **Indexing** tab of the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app), Algolia stores your Shopify blog posts in a dedicated index `PREFIX_articles`.
The default prefix is `shopify`.

### Blogs schema

Algolia stores your blogs in the following format:

```jsoncjsonc
{
  _tags: [
    blog_id,
  ],
  author: {
    name,
    objectID,
  },
  blog: {
    commentable,
    created_at,
    feedburner,
    feedburner_location,
    handle,
    objectID,
    title,
    updated_at
  },
  body_html,
  body_html_safe,
  created_at,
  handle,
  image,
  meta,
  named_tags: {},
  objectID,
  published_at,
  tags: [],
  title,
  updated_at,
}
```

### Searchable attributes for blogs

By default, these attributes are [searchable](/guides/managing-results/must-do/searchable-attributes/).
They're ranked in order of relevance—for example, results with a match in the `title` attribute rank before results with a match in the `handle` attribute:

1. `title`
1. `handle`
1. `tags`
1. `blog.title`
1. `blog.handle`
1. `unordered(author.name)`
1. `unordered(body_html_safe)`

### Remove blog posts from search results

To remove a blog post from the search results:

- Add `algolia-ignore` to its list of tags
- Add `[hidden]` to its title

### Remove entire blogs from search results

Blog posts belong to blogs.
To remove all articles from a blog from the search results,
add `[hidden]` to the blog name.

## Pages

If you select **Index pages** (on the **Indexing** tab of the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app), Algolia stores your Shopify blog posts in a dedicated index `PREFIX_pages`.
The default prefix is `shopify`.

### Pages schema

Algolia stores your pages in the following format:

```jsoncjsonc
{
  author,
  body_html,
  body_html_safe,
  created_at,
  handle,
  meta,
  objectID,
  published_at,
  shop_id,
  template_suffix,
  title,
  updated_at,
}
```

### Searchable attributes for pages

By default, these attributes are [searchable](/guides/managing-results/must-do/searchable-attributes/).
They're ranked in order of relevance—for example, results with a match in the `author` attribute rank before results with a match in the `body_html` attribute:

1. `author`
1. `body_html`
1. `title`

### Remove pages from search results

To remove a page from the search results,
add `[hidden]` to its title.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  To hide the `[hidden]` phrase on your page,
  replace `{{ page.title }}` with `{{ page.title | replace: "[hidden]", "" }}`.
  For more information, see [`replace`](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/replace/)
