  How to configure Algolia inside your Shopify site.
---

Algolia Search and Discovery is a **Shopify Plus certified app**.
You can use it with your Shopify Plus or Shopify stores.

After [installing](/integration/shopify/getting-started/quick-start/) the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app, configure your store.

## Indexing

As soon as you update your credentials, Algolia begins indexing your content.

Algolia stores your data in [indices](/integration/shopify/sending-and-managing-data/introduction-to-shopify-indexing/). View and edit your indices in the [**Indices** tab](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer) of your Algolia dashboard.

An Algolia index is composed of **records**: a record could be one of your products or a blog post in Shopify. These products have **attributes**, which are stored as key-value pairs. For example, a product attribute could be the description of a shirt, a link to a picture of it, or its price. Default attributes for different Shopify records are described in the [schemas section](/integration/shopify/sending-and-managing-data/schemas/) of the documentation.

You can index four types of Shopify data:

- Products (and their variants)
- Collections
- Blog posts and articles
- Pages

Select the attributes you want to make searchable by toggling the relevant **Enable** buttons and then save your changes.

## Store configuration

After your data is indexed and you have installed the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app in your theme, you can integrate the following Algolia features:

- An **autocomplete menu** implemented with the [`autocomplete`](/api-reference/widgets/autocomplete/js/) widget.
- A **search results page** that includes a bundle of [`instantsearch`](/api-reference/widgets/instantsearch/js/) widgets.

From the **Search options** tab in the Algolia Search and Discovery app, you can choose to use the autocomplete menu and InstantSearch results page to replace Shopify's default results page.

## Search options

### Sort orders

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  This option only applies if you plan to use the Algolia **InstantSearch results page**.
</Note>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

In the **Search options** tab of the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app, you can choose which "sort orders" to activate, how to name them, and which ones to display first.

[Sorting](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/) is done at indexing time. This means that for each sort order, a new index is created. The new index contains the same amount of records as the main one.
**Ensure any increase in record count is within your [plan's quota](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).**

### Faceting

<Note>
  This option only applies if you plan to use the Algolia **InstantSearch results page**.

[Faceting](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/) is the technical word used to describe navigation using filters. Facets are primarily used to refine searches.

Configure facets in the **Search options** tab of the Algolia Search and Discovery app.

Drag potential facets to choose their order and mark them as active or inactive.

Hover over a facet and click the edit button to set its name, type, and indicate if it's searchable. Marking a facet as searchable allows a user to search through its subcategories. Only mark you should mark a facet as searchable when it has too many subcategories to display simply.

#### Facet types

The Algolia AI Search & Discovery app offers five facet types:

- **slider**: A simple slider for numeric values.
- **conjunctive**: Filters using AND between refinements.
- **disjunctive**: Filters using OR between refinements.
- **menu**: A list of possible values from which one can be selected.
- **hidden**: A hidden facet in the active list is added to the [`attributesForFaceting`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesForFaceting/) setting but not displayed on the search page.

#### Facet sources

Facets can come from four different sources:

- **Default attributes**: these attributes are detailed in the [schemas section](/integration/shopify/sending-and-managing-data/schemas/)
- **Variant options**: If you're using aspects like "Color" to distinguish your variants, this will show up here
- **[Named tags](/integration/shopify/sending-and-managing-data/named-tags/)**
- **[Metafields](/integration/shopify/sending-and-managing-data/metafields/)**.

#### Facets on product collections

To facet on collections of products, go to the [**Collection pages**](/integration/shopify/advanced-customization/collection-search-page/) tab of the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app and enable it.

- **Collections indexing** enables searching within collections.
- **Collection page indexing** enables collection faceting for the InstantSearch results page.

#### Add custom facets

You can add custom facets in the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app to ensure they're added as attributes for faceting.

### Which settings are handled by the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app and which by the Algolia dashboard?

Algolia AI Search & Discovery handles these settings:

- Indexing (products, collections, indexing queue)
- Sorting strategies
- Facets
- Click and conversion events
- UI widgets (InstantSearch and Autocomplete)

Go to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/dashboard) to change these settings:

- Searchable and irretrievable attributes (on top of the default ones)
- Relevance settings
- Synonyms
- Query Suggestions
- Rules (transform queries, return custom data)
- Personalization and AI features

For **merchandising** you can use either the Algolia dashboard or the Shopify admin.

Any change you make in the Algolia dashboard overwrites the default index settings,
**except** facets ([`attributesForFaceting`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesForFaceting/)) and the sort order of the products index.
Updating settings for faceting and sort order from within the Shopify admin overwrites changes made to these settings in the Algolia dashboard.

## Synonyms
