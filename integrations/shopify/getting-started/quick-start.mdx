The Algolia AI Search & Discovery app replaces Shopify's built-in search with Algolia's fast and configurable search.
Algolia connects to your Shopify store and indexes your products and collections.
Your users can immediately find results thanks to Algolia's autocomplete menu on every page.
For more filtering options, you can add full search results pages.

Algolia Search and Discovery is a **Shopify Plus certified app**.
You can use it with your Shopify Plus or Shopify stores.
