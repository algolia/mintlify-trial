  Implement full search results page in your Shopify app with Algolia InstantSearch.
---

Algolia AI Search & Discovery includes a search results page powered by InstantSearch.
It replaces your default Shopify search results page and comes with several InstantSearch widgets.

## Enabling the InstantSearch results page

To enable the InstantSearch results page:

1. Add the [Algolia Search App Embed](/integration/shopify/getting-started/quick-start/#enable-instantsearch-for-collection-pages) to your theme
1. Add [Algolia App Blocks](/integration/shopify/getting-started/quick-start/#enable-autocomplete). App Embed must first be enabled before the App Block will work.

## Configuration

To configure the InstantSearch page, go to the **Search options** tab in your Shopify app.

#### Advance customization

You can use [custom hooks](/integration/shopify/building-search-ui/frontend-custom-events/#instantsearch-hooks) for advanced customization.
