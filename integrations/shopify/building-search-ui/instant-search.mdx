Algolia AI Search & Discovery includes a search results page powered by InstantSearch.
It replaces your default Shopify search results page and comes with several InstantSearch widgets.

## Enabling the InstantSearch results page

To enable the InstantSearch results page:

1. Add the [Algolia Search App Embed](/integration/shopify/getting-started/quick-start/#enable-instantsearch-for-collection-pages) to your theme
1. Add [Algolia App Blocks](/integration/shopify/getting-started/quick-start/#enable-autocomplete). App Embed must first be enabled before the App Block will work.

## Configuration

To configure the InstantSearch page, go to the **Search options** tab in your Shopify app.
