- `algolia.instantsearch.beforeInit` is emitted before the InstantSearch library is initialized
- `algolia.instantSearch.afterInit` is emitted after the InstantSearch library is initialized
- `algolia.instantsearch.hitClickAction` is emitted when a user clicks on an InstantSearch result
- `algolia.instantSearch.onError` is emitted when the InstantSearch library. reports an [error](/api-reference/widgets/instantsearch/js/#widget-param-error)
- `algolia.instantSearch.onRender` is emitted when all InstantSearch widgets have been [rendered](/api-reference/widgets/instantsearch/js/#widget-param-render)
- `algolia.instantsearch.beforeInitSortOrders` is emitted before InstantSearch sorting is initialized
