The Algolia integration for Shopify includes an [app block](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks/app-blocks) built with [Algolia Recommend](/guides/algolia-recommend/overview/) that you can add to your store's pages to show product recommendations.

## Before you begin

Before you can show recommendations in your store, check that you've set up Recommend:

- [Enable Algolia for your Shopify theme](/integration/shopify/getting-started/quick-start/#enable-algolia-on-your-theme).
- You're sending [click and conversion events](/integration/bigcommerce/search-settings/events/).
  Algolia Recommend relies on click and conversion events to continuously improve its recommendations.
  You can also [upload events via CSV](/guides/algolia-recommend/how-to/csv-upload/) to get started.
- You have a [Recommend model](/guides/algolia-recommend/how-to/set-up/#train-the-recommend-models/) trained in your Algolia dashboard.
- Recommend is not compatible with Shopify Markets.

## Enable Recommend

1. To add the Algolia Recommend app block to your theme, open your [theme editor](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/customizing-themes/edit), click **Add section**, go to the **Apps** tab, and select **Algolia Recommend**.

1. Select the Recommend model for the app block, complete the settings, save your changes.

Once your model training is completed and meets the criteria set for the app block, the recommendations app block will appear on your store's page.

### Customize

You can use [custom hooks](/integration/shopify/building-search-ui/frontend-custom-events/#recommend-hooks) to customize how your recommendations will be rendered.
