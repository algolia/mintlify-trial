  Customize how out of stock products are handled with Algolia AI Search & Discovery.
---

The Algolia AI Search & Discovery app lets you choose if you want to keep or remove out-of-stock products from the search results.

## Out-of-stock policies

Out-of-stock product variants are removed from the search results based on [filters](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/).
Filtering relies on the `inventory_quantity` and `inventory_policy` attributes of the
[product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/product-variant) resource.
A product variant is out-of-stock if the `inventory_quantity` attribute is 0.
The `inventory_policy` attribute can be `allow` if you explicitly decided to [continue selling a product when it's out of stock](#continue-selling-out-of-stock-products). Otherwise, this attribute is `deny`.

For handling out-of-stock product variants in the search results,
you can choose between these policies.

- **Include all out-of-stock products in the search results.** No filter is applied. All products are included in the search results.
- **Remove all out-of-stock products from the search results.** A filter `inventory_quantity>0` is applied when searching Only in-stock items are included in the search results.
- **Remove out-of-stock products, except those marked explicitly as available.** A filter `inventory_available:true` is applied when searching. The `inventory_available` attribute is true, when the `inventory_quantity` attribute is greater than 0, **or** when the `inventory_policy` attribute is set to `allow` for that product.

## Select your out-of-stock policy

To select your policy for handling out-of-stock items in the search results:

1. In your Shopify admin, open the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app.

1. On the **Search options** tab, go to the **Additional settings > Out of stock items** section.

   ![Dialog for handling out-of-stock items in search results in the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app in the Shopify admin](/doc/assets/images/integrations/shopify/stock-policy/1-stock-policy-feature-dfdc1c79.jpeg)

1. Select your policy for handling out-of-stock items:

   - **Show all out of stock items in search results**.
     Out-of-stock items are included in the search results.
     This is the default.

   - **Hide all out of stock items in search results**.
     Out-of-stock items are removed from search results.

   - **Hide out of stock items - except those marked as available**.
     Out-of-stock items are removed from search results,
     except products with the [**Continue selling when out of stock**](#continue-selling-out-of-stock-products) option.
     After selecting this option, you might need to reindex your product catalog.

## Continue selling out-of-stock products

To select which products are included in the search results when they're out of stock:

1. Go to the **Products** page in your Shopify admin.
1. Select a product you want to show in the search result when it's out of stock.
1. In the **Inventory** section,
   select **Track quantity** and **Continue selling when out of stock**.

The selected products are now included in the search results, even when they're out of stock.

## UI updates

The UI widgets of the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app have been updated to support this feature.
You can find the Autocomplete and InstantSearch widgets in these files:

- [`algolia_autocomplete.js.liquid`](https://shopify.algolia.com/shopify/assets/javascripts/v4/algolia_autocomplete.js.liquid)
- [`algolia_instant_search.js.liquid`](https://shopify.algolia.com/shopify/assets/javascripts/v4/algolia_instant_search.js.liquid).

### Autocomplete updates

In Autocomplete v1, filters are located in the `algolia_autocomplete_product_plugin.js.liquid` file:

```jsjs
+   // Filters for stock policy
+   let stockPolicyFilter = '';
+
+  if (algolia.config.stock_policy === 'deny') {
+    // For 'deny', filter out all items based on inventory quantity
+    stockPolicyFilter = 'inventory_quantity > 0';
+  } else if (algolia.config.stock_policy === 'continue') {
+    /**
+     * For 'continue', filter on an `inventory_available` attribute with a
+     * value dependent on:
+     * `inventory_quantity > 0 OR inventory_policy == 'continue'`
+     */
+    stockPolicyFilter = 'inventory_available:true';
+  }

  algolia.productsPlugin = {
    getSources({ query, setContext }) {
      return [
        {
          sourceId: 'products',
          getItems() {
            return getAlgoliaResults({
              searchClient: algolia.searchClient,
              queries: [
                {
                  indexName: config.index_prefix + 'products',
                  params: {
                    query,
                    hitsPerPage: config.products_autocomplete_hits_per_page,
                    clickAnalytics: config.analytics_enabled,
+                   filters: stockPolicyFilter,
                    distinct: algolia.config.show_products
                  },
                },
              ],
```

In older versions of the Autocomplete widget, the `algolia_autocomplete.js.liquid` file includes the following changes:

```jsjs
+    // Filters for stock policy
+    var stockPolicyFilter = null;
+
+    /**

+    if (algolia.config.stock_policy && section === 'products') {
+      if (algolia.config.stock_policy === 'allow') {
+        /**
+         * For 'allow', we don't need to add any filter as we want to continue
+         * displaying all out of stock items.
+         */
+      } else if (algolia.config.stock_policy === 'deny') {
+        // For 'deny' we will filter out all items based on inventory quantity
+        stockPolicyFilter = 'inventory_quantity > 0';
+      } else if (algolia.config.stock_policy === 'continue') {
