  Track top searches and get notified with the Algolia triggers for Shopify Flow.
---

[Shopify Flow](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-flow/) is an automation platform for your Shopify store.
It has two main parts:

- **Triggers** are events that start workflows.
- **Actions** are tasks, such as sending Slack messages or emails.

## Algolia triggers for Shopify Flow

The Algolia AI Search & Discovery app includes these triggers:

- **Top searches.** Track the most popular searches and the most looked-at results. This trigger is scheduled every day at 1 PM UTC.
- **Top searches with no results.** Track queries that returned no results. This trigger is scheduled every day at 1 PM UTC.
- **Indexing paused.** This trigger runs when your Algolia indexing pauses.

## Set up workflows with Algolia

The following workflow notifies you through Slack messages and emails about your top searches.
For more information, see [Creating workflows in Shopify Flow](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-flow/create-workflow/).

### Before you begin

Install the [Shopify Flow](https://apps.shopify.com/flow) app. If you want to send Slack messages to channels, install the Flowbot app in your Slack workspace.

### Activate the trigger

First, activate the trigger in the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app.

1. In your Shopify admin, go to the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app.
1. Open the **Shopify Flow** tab.
1. Activate the **Top Searches** trigger.

<Note>
  If you skip this step, you can still select the Algolia triggers in Shopify Flow,
  but no action will be performed unless you activate the trigger in the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app.
</Note>

### Configure the trigger

After [activating the trigger](#activate-the-trigger), you can use it in your workflows.

1. In your Shopify admin, select **Flow** in the **Apps** section of the sidebar.

1. Click **Create workflow**.

1. Click **Select trigger**, find the **Algolia AI Search & Discovery** app,
   and select the **Top Searches** trigger.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Note>
  If you didn't [activate the trigger](#activate-the-trigger) yet,
  you can set up the workflow, but you won't receive any notifications.
</Note>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Configure action: send Slack messages

When the trigger event is fired, you can perform one or more _actions_,
such as, sending a Slack message.

1. In the Shopify Flow app, click **Add action**.

1. Find the **Slack** app.

1. If it's your first time using the Slack action in Shopify, click **Connect**.

1. Select the **Send Slack message** action.

1. Enter the details for your Slack message:

   1. Optional: add a description for this Slack notification.

   1. Select a Slack member ID or enter a channel name which should receive the Slack message.

      {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

      <Note>
        To find your Slack member ID, visit your profile, click the icon and
        select **Copy member ID**.
      </Note>

      {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

   1. Under the **Message** field, click **Add a variable** and select the `topSearchesMarkdown` variable.
      When the Slack message is sent, this variable will be replaced with the message body.

1. Click **Turn on workflow**.

Now, you'll receive a Slack message every day at 1 PM UTC with your top searches.

### Configure action: send emails

1. In the Shopify Flow app, select your workflow and add another action.

1. From the Shopify app, select the **Send internal email** action.

1. Enter the details for your email.

   1. Optional: add a description for this email notification.
   1. Enter one or more email addresses and a subject.
   1. Under the **Message** field, click **Add a variable** and select the `topSearchesHtml` variable.
      When the email is sent, this variable will be replaced with the email body.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

Now, in addition to a Slack message, you'll receive an email with your top searches.
