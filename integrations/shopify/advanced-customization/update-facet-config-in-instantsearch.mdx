title: Update the facet configuration in InstantSearch
description: |-
  Update the facet configuration for refinementList widgets in your Shopify app to enhance the user experience.
---

The facets are configured within the Shopify-Algolia integration, but there may be scenarios when you want to configure more advanced options within the relevant facet types that are used.

An example of this could be handling a scenario when there are long lists of facet values.

The [`refinementList`](/api-reference/widgets/refinement-list/js/) widget is used to lets users refine the search results by facets that are configured as _conjunctive_ or _disjunctive_ facet types
within the [Shopify search configuration](/integration/shopify/building-search-ui/instant-search/#configuration).

By default, the `refinementList` widget [shows 10 items](/api-reference/widgets/refinement-list/js/#widget-param-limit) and hides the rest.

While you can change the total number of items shown in a list with the [`beforeInstantSearchFacetLimitNumber`](/integration/shopify/building-search-ui/frontend-custom-events/#beforeinstantsearchfacetlimitnumber) hook, this updates all `refinementList` widgets which could still end up having some values hidden.

In this scenario, it's best to show a smaller number of items and to have a **Show more** button to view the rest of the items.

You can achieve this with the [`beforeInstantSearchOptions`](/integration/shopify/building-search-ui/frontend-custom-events/#beforeinstantsearchoptions) hook.

## Example

This example updates the configuration of all `refinementList` widgets to show only 5 facets, and to display a **Show more** button for revealing the rest of the facets.

```js js
document.addEventListener("algolia.hooks.initialize", function () {
  algoliaShopify.hooks.registerHook(
    "beforeInstantSearchOptions",
    function (options) {
      // Loop through the facet widgets.
      const widgets = options.facets.widgets.map((widget) => {
        // Only update the refinementList widget params.
        if (widget.name !== "refinementList") {
          return widget;
        }

        // This updates all `refinementList` widgets.
        // If you only want to update specific facet(s),
        // you can target them by checking the value of `widget.params.container`.

        return {
          ...widget,
          params: {
            ...widget.params,
            limit: 5,
            showMore: true,
          },
        };
      });

      return {
        ...options,
        facets: {
          ...options.facets,
          widgets,
        },
      };
    },
  );
});
```
