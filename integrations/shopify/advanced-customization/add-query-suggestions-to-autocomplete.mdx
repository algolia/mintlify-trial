  Add Query Suggestions to the Autocomplete search in your Shopify app.

The default Shopify templates include Autocomplete search out-of-the-box.
This lets users search across [selected indexes](/integration/shopify/getting-started/configuration/#indexing) for products, collections, blogs, or pages.

Algolia Query Suggestions generate suggested search terms [based on popular searches](/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js/#how-query-suggestions-work).

If you want to use Query Suggestions in the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app, you must:

- Use an Algolia application with the [Query Suggestions](/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js/#set-up-query-suggestions) feature turned on.
- Enable Query Suggestions for Autocomplete.

## Enable Query Suggestions for Autocomplete

1. Open the **Search options** tab in the Algolia AI Search & Discovery app
1. Go to the **Autocomplete configuration options** section
1. Select the **Enable Query Suggestions** option.

![The Query Suggestions options in the Autocomplete configuration screen in the Shopify admin](/doc/assets/images/integrations/shopify/advanced-customization/6-query-suggestions-settings-9c893cae.jpg)

By default, the engine uses an index name computed with your index prefix. If the index name doesn't correspond to your Query Suggestions index name, you can replace it.

1. Click **Save**. Your Autocomplete menu should now show Query Suggestions.
