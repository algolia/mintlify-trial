Algolia AI Search & Discovery lets you customize the sort order and facets of individual collection pages.
If you're using the [Collection Search Page](/integration/shopify/advanced-customization/collection-search-page/)
feature of Algolia AI Search & Discovery, you can customize collections.

## Enable customization for a collection

Go to **Collection Pages** and scroll down to the list of collections.

Select a collection, click **Customise** and click **Enable**.

## Configure sort orders and facets

Once the customization is enabled, active sort orders and facets from the **Collection Pages** feature are copied over for the selected collection.
It will then be possible to customize them for the collection.

### Sort orders

You can choose which sort orders you want to activate for this particular collection, how you want to call them, and which ones you want to display first.

Each index has one ranking formula. This means, for each sort order, you'll create a new index.
Make sure that the increased number of records **won't exceed your [plan's quota](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/)**.
If you activated the same sort order in **Search options** and **Collection Pages**,
a new index isn't created. The duplicate index previously created is used instead.

### Merchandising

## Turn off Collection customization

![The Collection customization disable option in the Shopify admin](/doc/assets/images/integrations/shopify/collection-pages/12-collection-customisation-disable-587de7d4.jpeg)

To turn off customization for a particular collection, go to the bottom of the page and click **Disable**.
The collection reverts to using the sort orders and facets defined in **Collection pages**.
