  Tips for increasing indexing performance.

The v2 indexing jobs (available from [cartridge version 23.5.0](/integration/salesforce-commerce-cloud-b2c/guides/migrating-to-23-5-0/)) bring many performance improvements compared to the v1 jobs.

This guide provides additional tips to help you further improve your indexing performance.

## Only export the attributes which are necessary for your business

Retrieving attributes from the database and exporting them is expensive. Every millisecond counts when the number of products is high.

Limit the number of attributes you're exporting to the ones you're using on your frontend.
Removing unused, forgotten, and stale attributes improves job run times.

## Pay attention to both complex and simple attributes

Your products have:

- Simple (static) attributes that can be retrieved by a simple "getter" method
- Complex (dynamic) attributes which must be calculated at the time of the query, for each product, for each locale.

When considering which attributes to remove from the list of exported attributes, start by eliminating the complex ones first.

## Number of currencies and locales affects run time

If your site has unused currencies or locales configured, consider removing them in Business Manager as products will be exported using these locales and currencies as well.
The list of indexed locales can also be restricted using the `Locales for indexing` [custom preference](/integration/salesforce-commerce-cloud-b2c/getting-started/custom-preferences/),
or at the job step level, in the `localesForIndexing` parameter.

When indexing a lot of locales, the size of indexing batches is increased (one record is generated per locale), which can lead to memory errors in the indexing jobs.
Reduce the number of locales or lower the [chunk size](#chunk-size) if you encounter a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error.

A job can also become slow when dealing with a large number of locales.
In that case, a strategy is to split it in separate jobs, each one indexing a subset of locales.
This is achieved by using the `localesForIndexing` [job step parameter](/integration/salesforce-commerce-cloud-b2c/indexing/product-indexing/full-indexing/#algoliaproductindex-job-step-parameters).

## Chunk size

The default chunk size for the new jobs is 100, while the maximum is 1,000.
You can change the chunk size in `steptypes.json`, under `"@type-id": "..."` > `"chunk-size"`.

The products to be exported are broken down into chunks of this size, with multiple chunks executing in parallel.
To achieve the best performance, you can set this value higher if you have a large catalog with many products.

<Warning>
  Setting the chunk size too high can cause issues:

  - it can result in an `api.jsJSONStringLength` [quota violation](https://salesforcecommercecloud.github.io/b2c-dev-doc/docs/current/quota/html/API_Quotas.html#category_Script).
    A quota warning will be issued, but the platform won't prevent execution of the job because the quota is not currently enforced.
  - it can cause memory issues when a large number of locales are enabled, because one product or variant record is generated for each locale and added to the batch.
    If a job fails with a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error, you need to lower the chunk size.

## Environment

Jobs run significantly faster on Production instances than they do on sandboxes due to having more resources assigned to them.

<Note>
  On-demand sandboxes can be configured with [three tiers of allocated resources](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.rn_b2c_sandbox_w8978426_ods_resource_prof_mjb.htm\&type=5).

## Job scheduling

Schedule jobs in a staggered manner.
Don't run jobs at the same time even if they access different resources or business object types.

Try to run high-volume jobs, such as full catalog exports, during low-traffic hours, like nighttime.

Don't schedule jobs to start at the top of the hour, instead schedule them to start at random minutes of the hour (for example 2:17 or 6:39).
This is due to your B2C instances running on multi-tenant servers.
If every tenant configures their job to start at the top of the same hour, that means slower access for everyone.

## Use each job for its intended purpose

Partial update jobs, such as `AlgoliaProductInventoryExport_v2` and `AlgoliaProductPriceExport_v2`, finish quickly compared to a full catalog export job, since they only export one relatively easily calculable attribute.
The list of attributes for partial update jobs can be extended, but this will increase job run times.

## Content indexing

Content datasets and indices tend to be smaller than product catalogs, since there are usually fewer content assets and pages than products. Content updates also tend to be less time- and performance- sensitive and occur less often compared to product updates. However, if content job performance is critical, consider the following strategies:

- If Page Designer or Content Assets aren't part of your usage, you can tailor your indexing preferences by configuring the `includedContent` to specify which types of content are indexed.
- For those indexing all Page Designer components by setting `indexOnlySearchables` to false, it's advisable to review and specify both `indexableAttributes` and `ignoredAttributes`. This can help to minimize unnecessary indexing of content, such as style configurations, that do not need to be indexed.
