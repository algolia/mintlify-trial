  Send click and conversion events from your Salesforce B2C commerce store.
---

The integration can capture different [events](/guides/sending-events/getting-started/) and enable advanced [search features](/guides/sending-events/concepts/event-types/#events-by-features).
Events are sent by the frontend cartridges:

- **SFRA** sites emit events from the **int\_algolia\_sfra** cartridge.
- **SiteGenesis** sites emit events from the **int\_algolia\_controllers** cartridge.

Find statistics about these events in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events?).

Sending events enables you to use these features:

- [NeuralSearch](/guides/getting-started/neuralsearch/)

- [Algolia Recommend](/guides/algolia-recommend/overview/)

- [Personalization](/guides/personalization/classic-personalization/what-is-personalization/)

- [Dynamic Re-Ranking](/guides/algolia-ai/re-ranking/)

- [Query Categorization](/guides/algolia-ai/query-categorization/)

- [Search analytics](/guides/search-analytics/overview/)

- [Revenue analytics](/guides/search-analytics/concepts/metrics/#revenue)

- [A/B Testing](/guides/ab-testing/what-is-ab-testing/)

## Default events

By default, Algolia captures every keystroke in the search box to provide detailed [analytics](/guides/search-analytics/overview/).
The cartridge can also capture `view`, `click`, and `conversion` events when users add a product to their cart or complete a purchase.

To start capturing events, select **Enable insights events** in the integration's Business Manager module (**Business Manager > Merchant Tools > Algolia > Algolia**).
Event behavior depends on the cartridge you use.

<Note>
  You can also enable basic click and view events on InstantSearch and Autocomplete-powered pages and components such as search results, category landing pages, or the search box with an [Algolia dashboard setting](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/settings). However, since this doesn't enable additional conversion events triggered on pages such as the product detail page or the cart, you should use the Salesforce B2C cartridge-specific setting on the Business Manager.

### SFRA

When enabled, the SFRA cartridge sends the following events:

- [`view`](/api-reference/api-methods/viewed-object-ids/) and [`click`](/api-reference/api-methods/clicked-object-ids-after-search/), sent from Autocomplete, category pages, and the search results page.
- [`addedToCartObjectIDsAfterSearch`](/api-reference/api-methods/added-to-cart-object-ids-after-search/), sent when products are added to the cart.
- [`purchasedObjectIDsAfterSearch`](/api-reference/api-methods/purchased-object-ids-after-search/), sends a `purchase` event, with the relevant purchased product IDs when users reach the order confirmation page.

#### Keeping track of users and search queries for conversion events

To provide better insights, the conversion events sent should ideally contain a [persistent `userToken`](/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken/#persistent-user-token) and the ID of the search query that led to them. The SFRA cartridge has mechanisms to keep track of those.

##### `queryID`

If the cartridge can get the `queryID` of the search that triggered a conversion event, it's sent in the event payload.

- For **add-to-cart** events, there are two options:
  - If the action is performed from the [Quickview](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/sfra/guide/sfra-feature-list.html#quickview-capabilities), the `queryID` comes from the underlying InstantSearch instance.
  - If users click a search result, leading to the product page, the cartridge adds a `queryID` to the query string URL and uses it when a user adds the product to their cart.
- Since **purchase** events don't relate to a search, you must store each user's query IDs in their [browser's local storage](/guides/sending-events/guides/queryid/#track-the-queryid-in-cookies-or-local-storage) until the order confirmation page. The cartridge will only do this if a user has agreed to it, using [SFRA's system for tracking consent](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/sfra/guide/b2c-sfra-consent-tracking.html).

##### `userToken` and `authenticatedUserToken`

The cartridge uses SFCC's default `dwanonymous_` cookie to [set the `userToken`](/api-reference/api-methods/set-user-token/) on insights events.
For authenticated users, it also relies on the [session object](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/guide/b2c-function-reference.html#object-dwsystemsession) to retrieve and [set the `authenticatedUserToken`](/api-reference/api-methods/set-authenticated-user-token/).

### SiteGenesis

When enabled, the SiteGenesis cartridge sends the following events:

- `view` and `click`, sent from Autocomplete, category pages, and the search results page.
- `addedToCartObjectIDsAfterSearch`, sent when products are added to the cart.

To implement additional events such as **purchase**, refer to the [Insights client documentation](/api-client/methods/insights/).

### PWA Kit

If your frontend is built with the PWA Kit, implement events with [React InstantSearch](/guides/building-search-ui/events/react/).
