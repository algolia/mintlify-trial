  Learn how the indexing works with the Algolia Salesforce B2C Commerce cartridge.
---

The **int\_algolia** cartridge keeps your site's data in sync with Algolia.

## Key concepts

- **B2C object.** A business object of any B2C class such as `Product`, `Pricebook`, `ProductInventoryList`, or `ProductInventoryRecord`. A Product object has built-in and custom attributes, such as `ID`, `name`, `shortDescription`, `longDescription`, and more.

- **Algolia product record.** The JSON product object stored in the Algolia index. It has a different structure to that of a B2C Product object and contains all relevant data you configure the jobs to export, such as `price`, `in_stock`. Some of these attributes are simple values and some are more complex, see [Indexing attributes](/integration/salesforce-commerce-cloud-b2c/indexing/product-indexing/indexing-attributes/).
