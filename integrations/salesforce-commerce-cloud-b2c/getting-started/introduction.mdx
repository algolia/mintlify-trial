  Integrate Algolia with Salesforce B2C Commerce.

Algolia's cartridge unlocks best-in-class Search and Discovery on Salesforce B2C Commerce.

The cartridges synchronize product (including price and inventory), category, and content data, and powers search and discovery for both [SFRA (Storefront Reference Architecture)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/sfra/guide/sfra-overview.html) and SiteGenesis.
You can customize these InstantSearch.js-based experiences to match your brand's needs.
You can also use the backend cartridges on their own to synchronize data for headless,
[composable](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/getting-started.html) storefront integrations,
accelerated by Algolia's [React InstantSearch](/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/react/),
[Autocomplete](/ui-libraries/autocomplete/introduction/what-is-autocomplete/),
and [Recommend](/deprecated/recommend/introduction/getting-started/?client=React) UI libraries.

The integration works with Algolia's [Merchandising Studio](/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/),
[search analytics](/guides/search-analytics/overview/),
[NeuralSearch](/guides/getting-started/neuralsearch/),
[Personalization](/guides/personalization/what-is-personalization/),
and [Recommend](/guides/algolia-recommend/overview/).

## Compatibility

The cartridge supports these versions:

- Salesforce Commerce Cloud API version 21.7 (compatibility mode: 21.2)

- SFRA version 6.0.0

A SiteGenesis-based site can use both pipeline and controller architectures simultaneously.
The Algolia cartridge uses controllers, but is fully compatible with your current pipeline architecture.
