  Learn how to configure the sources for Algolia's BigCommerce integration.
---

A _source_ is a combination of:

- An Algolia index name (must be unique)
- A BigCommerce channel (sources are per channel - each store can have multiple channels)
- A set of BigCommerce product data with currencies

You already set up a source during [installation](/integration/bigcommerce/get-started/installation/).
You can edit it and add or delete others.

## Trigger a full reindex

After [installing a BigCommerce source](/integration/bigcommerce/get-started/installation/),
you need to trigger a full reindex at least once to retrieve your products from BigCommerce.
You should also reindex if you change, add, or delete a source.

To trigger a full reindex:

1. Select the **Blue cloud icon** for the source you want to reindex.

1. To check the progress and reindexing progress, see [Monitor BigCommerce indexing](/integration/bigcommerce/indexing/monitoring-bigcommerce-indexing/).

## Custom fields

To index custom fields, you must first [trigger a full reindex](#trigger-a-full-reindex).

To configure a source for custom fields:

1. Select the **three dots icon** on the source and select **Edit Source**.
1. Select **Custom Fields**.
1. Enter a comma-separated list of custom field names to index.

## Metafields

To index metafields, you must first [trigger a full reindex](#trigger-a-full-reindex).

To configure a source for metafields:

1. Select the **three dots icon** on the source and select **Edit Source**.
1. Select **Metafields**.
1. Enter a key and namespace for either a **Product Metafield** or **Variant Metafield**, or both.

## Attributes to exclude

To exclude attributes from a [reindex](#trigger-a-full-reindex):

1. Select the **three dots icon** on the source and select **Edit Source**.
1. Select **Attributes to Exclude**.
1. Enter a comma-separated list of attributes to exclude from the Algolia index.
