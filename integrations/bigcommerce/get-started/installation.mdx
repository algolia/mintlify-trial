## Before you begin

To connect BigCommerce and Algolia, you need a BigCommerce store with owner access and an Algolia application with administrator access on a [build, premium, elevate plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/). You can [create one for free](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-your-apps/).

## Install the Algolia for BigCommerce app

1. Go to the [Algolia for BigCommerce app](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/algolia-search-discovery/).
1. Click **Get this app**.
1. Existing BigCommerce store - Log in
1. New to BigCommerce - Sign up
1. Click **Install**.
