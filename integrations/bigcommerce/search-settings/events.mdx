Learn how to send click and conversion events from your BigCommerce store to the Algolia Insights API.

By default, you'll send [click and view events](/guides/sending-events/concepts/event-types/) when users view or select search results.

To turn off the sending of click and conversion events,
clear the **Use click analytics** checkbox.

By default, a new anonymous user token is generated on every page refresh.
For more persistent user tokens, select **userToken is set using cookies depending on the user's approval**.

Before you can use cookies to store the user token,
you must turn on "Cookie consent tracking" in your BigCommerce control panel.
To find this option in your BigCommerce store, go to **Settings > Security & Privacy > Your customers' privacy.**
