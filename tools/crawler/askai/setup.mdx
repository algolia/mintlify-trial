## Add your domains

For security reasons, you must specify the domains you plan to use with Ask AI.
Wildcards aren't supported (for example, `*.example.com` won't work).
List each subdomain individually.
For example,  add `help.example.com` and  `docs.example.com` separately.

You can add domains:

- During initial configuration: [Data Sources > Crawler > Ask AI > Configurations](LINK)
- In the Ask AI Domains tab: [Data Sources > Crawler > Ask AI > Ask AI Domains](LINK)

## Define your prompts

Prompts help your large language model (LLM) understand user questions and decide how to respond.
Ask AI offers three default prompt templates to help you get started.
You can customize your prompts by using the templates and changing them or by creating your own.
This lets you tailor the tone, format, and guidance.
