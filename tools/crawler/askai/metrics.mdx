  Understand how users interact with your AI assistant and use metrics to improve their experience.

The metrics are:

{/* vale Vale.Spelling = NO */}

- **Ask AI Volume %.** Compares total search queries to Ask AI questions. A higher percentage means more users are engaging with the assistant instead of keyword search.
- **Upvote %.** Measures how often users rate answers as helpful.
- **Downvote %.** Measures how often users rate answers as unhelpful. Use this to identify issues with prompts or content.
- **Avg. Thread Depth.** Tracks how many "turns" (the back-and-forth between users and the AI assistant) it takes to resolve a query. A lower value may indicate clearer responses.
- **Voting by Topic.** Shows where users are satisfied or dissatisfied, broken down by topic. Useful for prompt tuning and finding content gaps.
- **Questions by Topic.** Shows which topics users ask about most. Helps identify high-interest areas and opportunities to improve content.

{/* vale Vale.Spelling = YES */}

Filter metrics by date range to uncover trends, refine prompts, and address content gaps.
