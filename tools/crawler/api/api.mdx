description: The Crawler API lets you manage and run your crawlers.
---

You can manage and run your crawlers from the dashboard, using the Algolia CLI, or with the Crawler API.

The **Crawler API** lets you:

- [Create and update your crawler configuration](/tools/crawler/api/configuration/update-crawler-configuration) to specify which URLs to crawl, when to crawl, how to extract records from the crawl, and where to index the extracted records.
- [Set the state of crawlers](/tools/crawler/api/state/crawl-urls), such as starting a crawl, pausing crawl schedules, or testing the crawler with specific URLs.
- [Manage your crawlers](/tools/crawler/api/manage/create-a-crawler): create, rename, and delete them.
- [List your registered domains.](/tools/crawler/api/domains/list-registered-domains)
- [Examine the status of crawler tasks.](/tools/crawler/api/tasks/retrieve-task-status)
