  Index your content with the Algolia Crawler.
---

The [Algolia Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/products/features/crawler/) extracts content from your site and makes it searchable.
Given a set of start URLs, the Crawler:

1. Visits these pages and extracts data that's relevant for search.
1. Discovers other pages through links (and extracts _their_ data).
1. Sends your data to your [Algolia indices](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/prepare-data-in-depth/#algolia-index). You can run the Crawler on a schedule to keep your Algolia indices up-to-date.

## Why you should use the Crawler

The Crawler simplifies uploading your data to Algolia and keeping your indices up-to-date.
Compared to using [the API clients or other methods](/guides/getting-started/ecosystem/) to index your data, using the Crawler has these benefits:

- You don't have to write and maintain code for extracting content, transforming it to indices, and scheduling periodic updates.
- It helps you extract data from unstructured content (such as HTML and PDF files).
- It can index your web pages when it's difficult to access the _sources_, for example, due to restricted access, or if you want to index different resources managed by different teams using different tools.

## Get started

The [Algolia Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/products/crawler/) is available as an add-on to your [plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).

To add, verify, and crawl your site, see [Create a new crawler](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/getting-started/create-crawler/).

<Note>
If you want to use the Crawler to index a technical documentation site, consider [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/), which also comes with a search UI.
If you use Netlify to host your website, use the [Netlify Crawler plugin](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/netlify-plugin/quick-start/)
